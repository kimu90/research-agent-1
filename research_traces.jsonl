The dataset contains 20 rows and 2 columns, named 'applicants' and 'n'.\n2. The 'applicants' column contains categorical data with 20 unique values, which appear to be names of companies or individuals.\n3. The 'n' column contains numerical data with a mean of 5.75, a standard deviation of 2.73, and a range of 3 to 14.\n4. There are no missing values in the dataset.\n5. The 'n' column has a single outlier, which is not specified in the analysis results.\n\n**Statistical Analysis:**\n\n1. Descriptive statistics:\n\t* Count: 20\n\t* Mean: 5.75\n\t* Standard deviation: 2.73\n\t* Minimum: 3\n\t* 25th percentile: 4\n\t* 50th percentile (median): 5\n\t* 75th percentile: 7.25\n\t* Maximum: 14\n2. Correlation analysis: There is only one numerical column, so there are no correlations to report.\n3. Categorical analysis: The 'applicants' column has 20 unique values, each with a frequency of 1.\n\n**Data Quality Checks:**\n\n1. Missing values: There are no missing values in the dataset.\n2. Outliers: There is a single outlier in the 'n' column, but its value is not specified.\n3. Data types: The 'applicants' column is of type object (string), and the 'n' column is of type integer.\n\n**Methodology Explanation:**\n\nThe analysis results suggest that a descriptive statistical analysis was performed on the dataset, including calculations of mean, standard deviation, and percentiles for the 'n' column. Additionally, a categorical analysis was performed on the 'applicants' column to identify unique values and their frequencies. No advanced statistical modeling or machine learning techniques were applied to the data.\n\n**Limitations and Assumptions:**\n\n1. The analysis is limited to the provided dataset and may not be representative of the larger population.\n2. The 'applicants' column is assumed to contain categorical data, and the unique values are assumed to be mutually exclusive.\n3. The 'n' column is assumed to contain numerical data, but the meaning and units of this column are not specified.\n4. The analysis does not account for potential relationships between the 'applicants' and 'n' columns, as no correlation analysis was performed.\n5. The single outlier in the 'n' column may have a significant impact on the analysis, but its value is not specified.", "numerical_accuracy": 0.0, "query_understanding": 0.75, "data_validation": 1.0, "reasoning_transparency": 0.0, "overall_score": 0.4375, "metrics_details": "{\"overall_score\": 0.4375, \"numerical_accuracy\": {\"score\": 0.0, \"details\": {\"calculations_found\": 0, \"calculation_examples\": []}}, \"query_understanding\": {\"score\": 0.75, \"details\": {\"term_coverage\": 0.5, \"has_methodology\": true, \"has_findings\": true, \"has_statistics\": true, \"has_data_reference\": true, \"covered_terms\": 3, \"total_query_terms\": 6}}, \"data_validation\": {\"score\": 1.0, \"details\": {\"missing_data_checked\": true, \"outliers_checked\": true, \"distribution_checked\": true, \"data_types_checked\": true}}, \"reasoning_transparency\": {\"score\": 0.0, \"details\": {\"error\": \"\\n**********************************************************************\\n  Resource \\u001b[93mpunkt_tab\\u001b[0m not found.\\n  Please use the NLTK Downloader to obtain the resource:\\n\\n  \\u001b[31m>>> import nltk\\n  >>> nltk.download('punkt_tab')\\n  \\u001b[0m\\n  For more information see: https://www.nltk.org/data.html\\n\\n  Attempted to load \\u001b[93mtokenizers/punkt_tab/english/\\u001b[0m\\n\\n  Searched in:\\n    - '/root/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/local/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/local/share/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/local/lib/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/share/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/local/share/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/lib/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/local/lib/nltk_data'\\n**********************************************************************\\n\"}}}", "calculation_examples": "[]", "term_coverage": 0.5, "analytical_elements": "{\"term_coverage\": 0.5, \"has_methodology\": true, \"has_findings\": true, \"has_statistics\": true, \"has_data_reference\": true, \"covered_terms\": 3, \"total_query_terms\": 6}", "validation_checks": "{\"missing_data_checked\": true, \"outliers_checked\": true, \"distribution_checked\": true, \"data_types_checked\": true}", "explanation_patterns": "{\"error\": \"\\n**********************************************************************\\n  Resource \\u001b[93mpunkt_tab\\u001b[0m not found.\\n  Please use the NLTK Downloader to obtain the resource:\\n\\n  \\u001b[31m>>> import nltk\\n  >>> nltk.download('punkt_tab')\\n  \\u001b[0m\\n  For more information see: https://www.nltk.org/data.html\\n\\n  Attempted to load \\u001b[93mtokenizers/punkt_tab/english/\\u001b[0m\\n\\n  Searched in:\\n    - '/root/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/local/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/local/share/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/local/lib/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/share/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/local/share/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/lib/nltk_data'\\n    - '/usr/local/lib/nltk_data'\\n**********************************************************************\\n\"}"}, "success": true}

ingredients\nIntegrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA)\n+8 more\n29 January 2025, at 8:00am\nShrimp farming in Vietnam is challenged by both low profitability and environmental degradation.", "CK, founder of Rongbient, wants to improve both sides of this equation with the help of a new model that uses seaweeds as a biofilter, a feed ingredient and as an extra revenue source for small-scale farmers.", "\nby\nSteven Hermans\nSeaweed industry analyst\nRongbient's founder, Cuong Ha (who is widely known as CK) in discussion with some of the Rongbient team\n\u00a9 Rongbient\nWhen confronted with the facts about\nshrimp\nfarming in\nVietnam\n, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the sector remains highly inefficient, at the same time struggling to contain its negative effects on the environment.", "One tonne of shrimp from intensive farms is responsible for\n14 tonnes of carbon emissions\n, while feeds are imported and antibiotic use is high, resulting in production costs double those of top competitor\nEcuador\n.", "\nOn the other hand, the extensive farming done by smallholder farmers has no water treatment and is acutely unproductive: as a result, less than a third of shrimp survive, farmers earn very little, ponds are degraded and waste is directly released into the environment.", "\nOn top of that, due to the preponderance of extensive farming, land use for shrimp ponds in Vietnam is considerable as well.", "At nearly 750,000 hectares, it\u2019s about three times as much as Ecuador, even if production is lower.", "\nShort on time?", "Watch this summary video\n\u201cThose were the questions that started\nRongbient\n,\u201d says CK: \u201chow can we improve the productivity of these lands and raise farmer\u2019s incomes, while at the same time reducing costs for intensive farms and the associated environmental impact?", "Seaweeds, Gracilaria in particular, then emerged as our solution.\u201d", "\nA new way to grow Gracilaria\nIndonesia has been the biggest grower of Gracilaria for decades, supplying the world\u2019s agar industry.", "Traditionally, Gracilaria is grown at the bottom of a pond, often with the addition of fertilisers to speed up the process.", "\nRongbient instead uses a net structure on top of the shrimp pond.", "As CK explains: \u201cWe decided on the surface net to access direct sunlight and improve the growth rate.", "It needed to be quite a fine mesh as well, because Gracilaria breaks easily, and you could potentially lose a lot of biomass to the bottom of the pond.", "Of course, because of the polyculture with shrimp, we don\u2019t need to add the extra nutrients like they do in Indonesia.", "\n\u201cWith our first test we got to a growth rate of roughly 2.5 percent per day.", "We are at 3.2 percent a day now, but we know there is room for improvement - we haven\u2019t even started optimising the strain yet.\u201d", "\nThe startup uses a rental system to encourage adoption. \u201c", "We don't ask farmers to drastically change the way they do things.", "We throw the cultivation system on top of the pond and let it grow.", "Every two months, we come and pick up the harvest.", "There are no upfront costs, the farmer only pays us the rental fee at harvest time,\u201d says CK.", "\n\u201cWe have a few hectares under cultivation now as a pilot, and we have been able to double farmers\u2019 income thanks to seaweed sales and improved shrimp survival rate, from 33 percent to 42 percent.\u201d", "he adds.", "\nRongbient uses a novel technique involving surface nets to grow Gracilaria in its shrimp ponds\n\u00a9 Rongbient\nFeeding it back\nPost-harvest, Rongbient processes the seaweeds into a feed additive for intensive shrimp farms.", "Seaweed-based feed additives are slowly gaining traction across Asia as they are showing good results in\nreducing the prevalence of EHP, WFS and EMS\n, at the same time\nimproving FCR\n, with the potential to even\nfight off Vibrio\n.", "\nIn Vietnam, Rongbient has seen similar positive results in its pilot.", "CK expands: \u201cWe have seen survival rate increase.", "Production grew by anywhere between 5 and 8 percent.", "Although we have seen a drop in feed conversion ratio, our main focus is on the feed additives: antibiotics, probiotics, et cetera.", "So far, we have managed to reduce usage by 20 percent.", "\n\u201cWe are about to start a pilot with one of the largest shrimp exporters to get more data and improve those numbers.", "We aim to cut down additives use by 50 percent if we get the resources to engineer the product.", "\n\u201cThe cost structure of shrimp farming in Vietnam is 50 to 70 percent for feed, with additives accounting for another 20 to 30 percent.", "If you can cut 50 percent of those additives, it would mean 10 to 15 percent of the total cost.", "That is close to a farmer\u2019s yearly profit margin.", "If we can also increase the survival rate a bit, we can effectively double farmers\u2019 profits.", "That\u2019s our value proposition.", "\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the use of banned antibiotics regularly leads to refused imports of Vietnamese shrimp in the US and EU, so this is about more than just cost savings.\u201d", "\nA bumper crop of Gracilaria, ready for processing\n\u00a9 Rongbient\nScaling it up\nWith close to half a million dollars in pre-orders, Rongbient is in the enviable position of having the problem of a lack of seaweed supply rather than a lack of demand.", "\nCK says: \u201cWe started in C\u00e0 Mau in the Mekong Delta where we have several hectares under cultivation now.", "We are rolling out a few more hectares over the next quarter to build more traction and revenue.", "\nOur government partners have been really positive about our system.", "They told us: \u2018if you can double our shrimp farmers\u2019 income, we want this in our communities.", "If you can scale it to 20,000-30,000 hectares, that's good enough for us.", "But if you can do more, that would be even better.\u2019", "\nShrimp farms in C\u00e0 Mau cover 280,000 hectares, so the potential is massive.\u201d", "\nWhile initial results have so far been very positive, finding the funds to scale up the solution is proving to be challenging.", "\nAs CK notes: \u201dWe are currently trying to raise 500,000 dollars in a pre-seed round to scale supply and improve our processing, but Vietnam is seen as too risky or too small a market for international investors, while local investors often prefer a concept that has already been proven abroad and that can be adapted to the local context.", "\n\u201cFor someone coming from a software background like myself, trying to find the funding for a real-world solution like this has been a

different compared to the temperate zones.", "Tropical seaweeds, such as Gracilaria and Eucheumatoids, allow for year-round production with growth cycles of only 30 to 45 days.", "This quick turnaround enables farmers to initiate, increase, or pause production in response to market trends or external factors.", "In contrast, temperate seaweeds are typically seasonal crops, primarily farmed during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in Southern Hemisphere.", "For example, kelps are seeded and harvested only once a year, with relatively short time windows for these activities.", "While Pyropia can be partially harvested throughout the season, it is highly perishable in its unprocessed form, necessitating processing facilities that can extend operations.", "Farmers of temperate species must thus meticulously plan ahead to ensure that their harvests align with market demand.", "\nWhether they\u2019re tropical or temperate has many other implications for the farming practices.", "Here are two of the more distinct ones:\nIn temperate zones, the seasonal nature of production requires a land-based hatchery stage to produce seed material for the following farming cycle.", "The\nland-based\nstage for temperate seaweed ensured investment into seedbanks and hatchery work, with the selection of the best-performing crop and improved seed material being available to farmers, either through cooperative hatchery operations (such as used in Japan) or privately owned hatchery operations (such ad used in South Korea).", "In contrast, tropical seaweeds do not necessarily require this step and have predominantly relied on clonal propagation since farming began in the 1970s.", "The lack of a similar infrastructure for tropical seaweeds has resulted in a decreased pool of genetic diversity, making crops more vulnerable to pests, diseases and climate change effects.", "\nMost tropical seaweed farming regions - such as Indonesia (pictured above) - rely on manpower for landing harvested seaweed\nThis is in marked contrast to the mechanical means used by kelp farmers in regions like South Korea (see first image in this feature)\n\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\nPain points for the seaweed industry differ in different regions (click on image to enlarge)\n\u00a9 Hatch Intelligence Services\nAnother significant difference is in post-harvest handling methods.", "Sun drying is the most common method for stabilising biomass in tropical regions due to high sunlight exposure year-round.", "However, this relatively low-cost technique often leads to minimal innovation in processing steps and product development.", "Furthermore, sun drying can destroy valuable compounds in the seaweed.", "On the other hand, temperate regions face challenges related to having short weather windows for harvesting large amounts of biomass simultaneously.", "This has driven farmers to explore diverse alternatives to drying \u2013 especially given the high energy requirements involved \u2013 leading to the exploration of more diverse and innovative product applications.", "\nLastly, a strong differentiating factor between tropical and temperate seaweed farming lies in their socio-economic contexts.", "Tropical seaweed farming often occurs in developing countries within the global South and is dominated by smallholder farmers who operate small farms in less regulated environments.", "For many coastal communities in these regions, seaweed farming is one of the few sources of livelihood, increasing their dependency on this activity while also exposing them to exploitation risks.", "\nIn contrast, temperate regions\u2014typically found in developed countries within the global North\u2014feature more company-type farming businesses due to more regulated access to farming.", "Farmers do have other economic opportunities, so seaweed becomes either a \u201cside gig\u201d as we witness in many North American emerging seaweed farming regions, or the next generations of farmers are lacking due to more attractive employment opportunities in the cities, such as the Japanese and South Korean trends show.", "\nTypical off-bottom tropical seaweed farm in Indonesia\n\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\nEmerging vs established seaweed farming regions\nWhen comparing established versus emerging seaweed farming regions, we see that established areas tend to exhibit a market pull that facilitates scale.", "For instance, East Asia has a long-standing cultural appreciation for seaweed as a staple food source.", "Similarly, Southeast Asia has experienced increased global demand for carrageenan and agar derived from cultivated seaweeds.", "In both cases, markets were initially supplied by wild-harvested seaweed; however, demand quickly outpaced supply, justifying the development of farming.", "\nConversely, many emerging seaweed farming regions perceive aquaculture as an opportunity for people, planet and profit but often lack a clear market pull to justify increased farming operations.", "This situation is frequently compounded by stringent regulatory environments due to the novelty of the activity and limited room for error.", "When seaweed farming began in now-established regions around 50 years ago, there were fewer regulations; now that these markets have matured, they tend to navigate existing businesses and supply chains.", "\nHatch Innovation Services, in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy, recently conducted a deep dive into policy frameworks for seaweed aquaculture across emerging, growing, and

of the findings.", "\nIn the third part, we will give our view on seaweed production trends.", "Since, of course there are also many nuances within the four categories presented here, we will go a bit more in-depth and share our predictions about where we can expect most of the seaweed biomass in the near future to come from.", "\nConclusion\nTo conclude this part, I suggest that we should go beyond talking about one generic seaweed industry.", "While discussing specific species may not always be practical, the four dimensions are presented instead.", "This approach will elevate

farmers.", "\nby\nSteven Hermans\nSeaweed industry analyst\nRongbient's founder, Cuong Ha (who is widely known as CK) in discussion with some of the Rongbient team\n\u00a9 Rongbient\nWhen confronted with the facts about\nshrimp\nfarming in\nVietnam\n, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the sector remains highly inefficient, at the same time struggling to contain its negative effects on the environment.", "One tonne of shrimp from intensive farms is responsible for\n14 tonnes of carbon emissions\n, while feeds are imported and antibiotic use is high, resulting in production costs double those of top competitor\nEcuador\n.", "\nOn the other hand, the extensive farming done by smallholder farmers has no water treatment and is acutely unproductive: as a result, less than a third of shrimp survive, farmers earn very little, ponds are degraded and waste is directly released into the environment.", "\nOn top of that, due to the preponderance of extensive farming, land use for shrimp ponds in Vietnam is considerable as well.", "At nearly 750,000 hectares, it\u2019s about three times as much as Ecuador, even if production is lower.", "\nShort on time?", "Watch this summary video\n\u201cThose were the questions that started\nRongbient\n,\u201d says CK: \u201chow can we improve the productivity of these lands and raise farmer\u2019s incomes, while at the same time reducing costs for intensive farms and the associated environmental impact?", "Seaweeds, Gracilaria in particular, then emerged as our solution.\u201d", "\nA new way to grow Gracilaria\nIndonesia has been the biggest grower of Gracilaria for decades, supplying the world\u2019s agar industry.", "Traditionally, Gracilaria is grown at the bottom of a pond, often with the addition of fertilisers to speed up the process.", "\nRongbient instead uses a net structure on top of the shrimp pond.", "As CK explains: \u201cWe decided on the surface net to access direct sunlight and improve the growth rate.", "It needed to be quite a fine mesh as well, because Gracilaria breaks easily, and you could potentially lose a lot of biomass to the bottom of the pond.", "Of course, because of the polyculture with shrimp, we don\u2019t need to add the extra nutrients like they do in Indonesia.", "\n\u201cWith our first test we got to a growth rate of roughly 2.5 percent per day.", "We are at 3.2 percent a day now, but we know there is room for improvement - we haven\u2019t even started optimising the strain yet.\u201d", "\nThe startup uses a rental system to encourage adoption. \u201c", "We don't ask farmers to drastically change the way they do things.", "We throw the cultivation system on top of the pond and let it grow.", "Every two months, we come and pick up the harvest.", "There are no upfront costs, the farmer only pays us the rental fee at harvest time,\u201d says CK.", "\n\u201cWe have a few hectares under cultivation now as a pilot, and we have been able to double

"Although we have seen a drop in feed conversion ratio, our main focus is on the feed additives: antibiotics, probiotics, et cetera.", "So far, we have managed to reduce usage by 20 percent.",

engineer the product.", "\n\u201cThe cost structure of shrimp farming in Vietnam is 50 to 70 percent for feed, with additives accounting for another 20 to 30 percent.", "If you can cut 50 percent of those additives, it would mean 10 to 15 percent of the total cost.", "That is close to a farmer\u2019s yearly profit margin.", "If we can also increase the survival rate a bit, we can effectively double farmers\u2019 profits.", "That\u2019s our value proposition.", "\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the use of banned antibiotics regularly leads to refused imports of Vietnamese shrimp in

positive about our system.", "They told us: \u2018if you can double our shrimp farmers\u2019 income, we want this in our communities.", "If you can scale it to 20,000-30,000 hectares, that's good

known as CK) in discussion with some of the Rongbient team\n\u00a9 Rongbient\nWhen confronted with the facts about\nshrimp\nfarming in\nVietnam\n, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the sector remains highly inefficient, at the same time struggling to contain its negative effects on the environment.", "One tonne of shrimp from intensive farms is responsible for\n14 tonnes of carbon emissions\n, while feeds are imported and antibiotic use is high, resulting in production costs double those of top competitor\nEcuador\n.", "\nOn the other hand, the extensive farming done by smallholder farmers has no water treatment and is acutely unproductive: as a result, less than a third of shrimp survive, farmers earn very little, ponds are degraded and waste is directly released into the environment.", "\nOn top of that, due to the preponderance of extensive farming, land use for shrimp ponds in Vietnam is considerable as well.", "At nearly 750,000 hectares, it\u2019s about three times as much as Ecuador, even if production is lower.", "\nShort on time?", "Watch this summary video\n\u201cThose were the questions that started\nRongbient\n,\u201d says CK: \u201chow can we improve the productivity of these lands and raise farmer\u2019s incomes, while at the same time reducing costs for intensive farms and the associated environmental impact?", "Seaweeds, Gracilaria in particular, then emerged as our solution.\u201d", "\nA new way to grow Gracilaria\nIndonesia has been the biggest grower of Gracilaria for decades, supplying the world\u2019s agar industry.", "Traditionally, Gracilaria is grown at the bottom of a pond, often with the addition of fertilisers to speed up the process.", "\nRongbient instead uses a net structure on top of the shrimp pond.", "As CK explains: \u201cWe decided on the surface net to access direct sunlight and improve the growth rate.", "It needed to be quite a fine mesh as well, because Gracilaria breaks easily, and you could potentially lose a lot of biomass to the bottom of the pond.", "Of course, because of the polyculture with shrimp, we don\u2019t need to add the extra nutrients like they do in Indonesia.", "\n\u201cWith our first test we got to a growth rate of roughly 2.5 percent per day.", "We are at 3.2 percent a day now, but we know there is room for improvement - we haven\u2019t even started optimising the strain yet.\u201d", "\nThe startup uses a rental system to encourage adoption. \u201c", "We don't ask farmers to drastically change the way they do things.", "We throw the cultivation system on top of the pond and let it grow.", "Every two months, we come and pick up the harvest.", "There are no upfront costs, the farmer only pays us the rental fee at harvest time,\u201d says CK.", "\n\u201cWe have a few hectares under cultivation now as a pilot, and we have been able to double farmers\u2019 income thanks to seaweed sales and improved shrimp survival rate, from 33 percent to 42 percent.\u201d", "he adds.", "\nRongbient uses a novel technique involving surface nets to grow Gracilaria in its shrimp ponds\n\u00a9 Rongbient\nFeeding it back\nPost-harvest, Rongbient processes the

WFS and EMS\n, at the same time\nimproving FCR\n, with the potential to even\nfight off Vibrio\n.", "\nIn Vietnam, Rongbient has seen similar positive results in its pilot.", "CK expands: \u201cWe have seen survival rate increase.", "Production grew by anywhere between 5 and 8 percent.", "Although we have seen a drop in feed conversion ratio, our main focus is on the feed additives: antibiotics, probiotics, et cetera.", "So far, we have managed to reduce usage by 20 percent.", "\n\u201cWe are about to start a pilot with one of the largest shrimp exporters to get more data and improve those numbers.", "We aim to cut down additives use by 50 percent if we get the resources to engineer the product.", "\n\u201cThe cost structure of shrimp farming in Vietnam is 50 to 70 percent for feed, with additives accounting for another 20 to 30 percent.", "If you can cut 50 percent of those additives, it would mean 10 to 15 percent of the total cost.", "That is close to a farmer\u2019s yearly profit margin.", "If we can also increase the survival rate a bit, we can effectively double farmers\u2019 profits.", "That\u2019s our value proposition.", "\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the use of banned antibiotics regularly leads to refused imports of Vietnamese shrimp in the US and EU, so this is about more than just cost savings.\u201d", "\nA bumper crop of Gracilaria, ready

quarter to build more traction and revenue.", "\nOur government partners have been really positive about our system.", "They told us: \u2018if you can double our shrimp farmers\u2019 income, we want this in our communities.", "If you can scale it to 20,000-30,000 hectares, that's good enough for us.", "But if you can do more, that would be even better.\u2019", "\nShrimp farms in C\u00e0 Mau cover 280,000 hectares, so the potential is massive.\u201d", "\nWhile initial results have so far been very positive, finding the funds to scale up the solution is proving to be challenging.", "\nAs CK notes: \u201dWe are currently trying to raise 500,000 dollars in a pre-seed round to scale supply and improve our processing, but Vietnam is seen as too risky or too small a market for international investors, while local investors often prefer a concept that has already been proven abroad and that can be adapted to the local context.", "\n\u201cFor someone coming from a software background like

"As CK explains: \u201cWe decided on the surface net to access direct sunlight and improve the growth rate.", "It needed to be quite a fine mesh as well, because Gracilaria breaks easily, and you could potentially lose a lot of biomass to the bottom of the pond.", "Of course, because of the polyculture with shrimp, we don\u2019t need to add the extra nutrients like they do in Indonesia.",

Watch this summary video\n\u201cThose were the questions that started\nRongbient\n,\u201d says CK: \u201chow can we improve the productivity of these lands and raise farmer\u2019s incomes, while at the same time reducing costs for intensive farms and the associated environmental impact? Seaweeds, Gracilaria in particular, then emerged as our solution", "\u201d\nA new way to grow Gracilaria\nIndonesia has been the biggest grower of Gracilaria for decades, supplying the world\u2019s agar industry", "Traditionally, Gracilaria is grown at the bottom of a pond, often with the addition of fertilisers to speed up the process", "Rongbient instead uses a net structure on top of the shrimp pond", "As CK explains: \u201cWe decided on the surface net to access direct sunlight and improve the growth rate", "It needed to be quite a fine mesh as well, because Gracilaria breaks easily, and you could potentially lose a lot of biomass to the bottom of the pond", "Of course, because of the polyculture with shrimp, we don\u2019t need to add the extra nutrients like they do in Indonesia", "\u201cWith our first test we got to a growth rate of roughly 2", "5 percent per day", "We are at 3", "2 percent a day now, but we know there is room for improvement - we haven\u2019t even started optimising the strain yet", "\u201d\nThe startup uses a rental system to encourage adoption", "\u201cWe don't ask farmers to drastically change the way they do things", "We throw the cultivation system on top of the pond and let it grow", "Every two months, we come and pick up the harvest", "There are no upfront costs, the farmer only pays us the rental fee at harvest time,\u201d says CK", "\u201cWe have a few hectares under cultivation now as a pilot, and we have been able to double farmers\u2019 income thanks to seaweed sales and improved shrimp survival rate, from 33 percent to 42 percent", "\u201d he adds", "Rongbient uses a novel technique involving surface nets to grow Gracilaria in its shrimp ponds\n\u00a9 Rongbient\nFeeding it back\nPost-harvest, Rongbient processes the seaweeds into a feed additive for intensive shrimp farms", "Seaweed-based feed additives are slowly gaining traction across Asia as they are showing good results in\nreducing the prevalence of EHP, WFS and EMS\n, at the same time\nimproving FCR\n, with the potential to even\nfight off Vibrio", "In Vietnam, Rongbient has seen similar positive results in its pilot", "CK expands: \u201cWe have seen survival rate increase", "Production grew by anywhere between 5 and 8 percent", "Although we have seen a drop in feed conversion ratio, our main focus is on the feed additives: antibiotics, probiotics, et cetera", "So far, we have managed to reduce usage by 20 percent", "\u201cWe are about to start a pilot with one of the largest shrimp exporters to get more data and improve those numbers", "We aim to cut down additives use by 50 percent if we get the resources to engineer the product", "\u201cThe cost structure of shrimp farming in Vietnam is 50 to 70 percent for feed, with additives accounting for another 20 to 30 percent", "If you can cut 50 percent of those additives, it would mean 10 to 15 percent of the total cost", "That is close to a farmer\u2019s yearly profit margin", "If we can also increase the survival rate a bit, we can effectively double farmers\u2019 profits", "That\u2019s our value proposition", "\u201cIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the use of banned antibiotics regularly leads to refused imports of Vietnamese shrimp in the US and EU, so this is about more than just cost savings", "\u201d\nA bumper crop of Gracilaria, ready for processing\n\u00a9 Rongbient\nScaling it up\nWith close to half a million dollars in pre-orders, Rongbient is in the enviable position of having the problem of a lack of seaweed supply rather than a lack of demand", "CK says: \u201cWe started in C\u00e0 Mau in the Mekong Delta where we have several hectares under cultivation now", "We are rolling out a few more hectares over the next quarter to build more traction and revenue", "Our government partners have been really positive about our system", "They told us: \u2018if you can double our shrimp farmers\u2019 income, we want this in our communities", "If you can scale it to 20,000-30,000 hectares, that's good enough for us", "But if you can do more, that would be even better", "\u2019\nShrimp farms in C\u00e0 Mau cover 280,000 hectares, so the potential is massive", "\u201d\nWhile initial results have so far been very positive, finding the funds to scale up the solution is proving to be challenging", "As CK notes: \u201dWe are currently trying to raise 500,000 dollars in a pre-seed round to scale supply and improve our processing, but Vietnam is seen as too risky or too small a market for international investors, while local investors often prefer a concept that has already been proven abroad and that can be adapted to the local context", "\u201cFor someone coming from a software background like myself, trying to find the funding for a real-world solution like this has been a sobering experience so far", "\u201d\nRongbient plans to use some of the Gracilaria ir harvests from its shrimp ponds as an aquafeed

the key environmental findings in the Oceans 2050 study include that seaweed farms bury carbon at rates similar to mangroves and seagrasses, which are known for their climate benefits", "The older and larger the seaweed farm, the more carbon it can store, according to the report", "A 2022 Environmental Defense Fund\nreport on carbon sequestration by natural seaweed\nstands quoted earlier data that dissolved carbon removed by seaweed is slowly replaced by atmospheric CO2 resulting in a migration from carbon from the air into the ocean", "Different types of seaweed process carbon differently,

"on cheetahs in the Kalahari", "According to the study, all the adult cheetahs observed scavenging were animals that had previously been relocated from different areas", "During the relocation process, they were temporarily put in holding enclosures known as bomas, where they were provided with supplementary feed in the form of carrion", "One of these cheetahs was a female that was relocated to Liwonde from Mountain Zebra National Park in South Africa", "At Liwonde, researchers observed her and her two sub-adult cubs approaching a group of eight cheetahs \u2014 one adult female, her five sub-adult cubs, and two adult males \u2014 that had killed a kudu and were eating it", "Once the group moved off the kill, the relocated mother and her cubs descended on the carcass and ate what was left", "Scavenging episodes like this could be explained by the easy access to food in a situation where food acquisition is potentially difficult due to \u201cold age, loss of hunting partners, or offspring in the case of a mother with cubs,\u201d the researchers note", "A close-up image of a cheetah in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya", "Image by Rhett A", "Butler /

programmes,\u201d said Minja who is also a Ph", "D", "candidate at the School of Biodiversity, One Health and Veterinary Medicine at the University of Glasgow, Scotland", "\u201cOne intriguing point I

cheetahs could potentially make them feel more at ease, reducing the perceived risk compared to scavenging on kills made by other carnivores", "\u201d\nHe said that in the Serengeti, cheetahs occasionally join other cheetahs at kills, \u201cmore often than we have seen them scavenging from dead carrion", "\u201d\nBettina Wachter, senior scientist in the Department for Evolutionary Ecology at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin, said the cheetahs observed scavenging were either old, with offspring, or in an area with many competitors, which might have put them under energetic pressure, thus they decided to take the risk", "\u201cIf cheetahs under energetic pressure accept carcasses to feed from, even though not readily, this can have effects on the prey population and interspecific competition,\u201d she said", "\u201cBut I would asses these effects as small as I assume cheetahs will only scavenge in rare occasions,\u201d added Wachter, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study", "The study does not explain the cheetahs\u2019 behavior and only suggests hypothetical causes and impacts", "However, the researchers are calling for further

country\u2019s endangered species law", "Today\u2019s petition springs from an analysis showing a staggering 90% population decline in less than two decades, primarily due to illegal fishing and overexploitation", "\u201cTime is running out for these quirky but important creatures", "Mexico urgently needs to crack down on illegal fishing and promote habitat restoration to prevent the total collapse of this sea cucumber population,\u201d said Alejandro Olivera, a senior scientist and Mexico representative at the Center for Biological Diversity", "\u201cProtecting chocolate chip sea cucumbers as a threatened species is a crucial step toward ensuring their survival", "\u201d\nThe chocolate chip sea cucumber, also known as the cookie dough sea cucumber, is found throughout the warm waters of the Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the coasts of Florida and Bermuda, extending south to Brazil", "In Mexico their numbers have plummeted because of legal overfishing followed by massive illegal fishing after a ban on the fishery", "The animal is dried and exported primarily to Asia where it is consumed for purported health purposes", "These sea cucumbers typically grow to about the size of a man\u2019s foot and have leathery, bumpy skin adorned with dark brown speckles, resembling chocolate chips in cookie dough", "The animals have a unique defense mechanism, expelling their insides to distract predators", "They also play a vital role in marine ecosystems by filtering and recycling nutrients from the seabed", "The Center\u2019s new scientific analysis reveals the alarming decline of the chocolate chip sea cucumber in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula", "In addition to historic legal fishing for the species, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has devastated sea cucumber populations, exceeding official quotas by more than 66%", "Between 2011 and 2018, an estimated 9,708 tons of chocolate chip sea cucumbers were illegally caught, valued at $34 million", "This rampant overfishing has reduced the species to a mere 10% of its original biomass, according to Mexican government assessments", "The Center's petition seeks immediate protection for the chocolate chip sea cucumber under Mexico's endangered species list", "If successful, this listing would mandate population monitoring, management plans and stricter regulations to prevent further decline", "The restrictive policy of Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, or Semarnat, of limiting proposals to protect imperiled species to specific time periods has caused significant delays in the past, with some petitioners waiting up to 10 years for their proposals to be considered", "The Center urges Semarnat to take swift action in this case, given the urgent need to protect the dwindling sea cucumber population", "The Center for Biological Diversity is a national, nonprofit conservation organization with more than 1", "7

Chronicle\nJune 14, 2024\nAfter surveying food market retailers in three New York City Chinatown districts, Cornell researchers have found genetic evidence that some endangered species of sea cucumbers \u2013 considered a pricey but nutritious dried delicacy \u2013 are being sold to consumers", "The researchers collected 103 samples of dried sea cucumbers from retail food shops", "By using mitochondrial DNA testing, they successfully identified 74 examples of sea cucumbers", "Eight were classified as brown sea cucumber, Isostichopus fuscus \u2013 which is threatened and found on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List due to overharvesting", "\u201cWe were able to genetically identify that the endangered species of brown sea cucumbers \u2013 around 10% of the sampled retail market \u2013 was being sold,\u201d said lead author Jesse Rodenbiker, a former postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment, in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and now an assistant teaching professor\u00a0in geography at Rutgers University", "\u201cIt suggests that the kind of level at which sea cucumbers are available on the market may pose a threat for biodiversity loss", "\u201d\nThe research, \u201c\nAdvancing One Health in Urban Seafood Markets: A Genetic and Social Analysis of Dried Sea Cucumber in Three New York City Chinatowns\n,\u201d was published April 25 in the journal Sustainability", "Rodenbiker and undergraduate students conducted retailer surveys and collected sea cucumber samples, and then brought samples to the laboratory of co-author\nNina Overgaard Therkildsen\n, associate professor in the Department of Natural Resources and the Environment (CALS)", "Her laboratory conducts research in conservation genomics and molecular ecology in the ocean environment", "There are 1,716 known species of sea cucumbers, which are marine invertebrates that behave like vacuum cleaners roaming the sea floor worldwide, Rodenbiker said", "Of these species, 16 are listed as either vulnerable or endangered", "In 2021 and 2022, Cornell students Kelly Su \u201924 and Erica Ruan \u201924 (who speak Mandarin and Cantonese) conducted semi-structured interviews with merchants in Chinese neighborhoods in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens", "Rodenbiker purchased dried sea cucumbers, usually labeled by originating geographic region \u2013 Japan, Mexico and South America", "In the interviews, the retailers acknowledged limited understanding of where the sea cucumbers originated", "Consumers are willing to pay premium prices for sea cucumbers, which are added to soups", "During the survey period, the price for sea cucumber was between $169 and $229 per pound", "\u201cAlthough the resolution on this pilot study was a bit coarse, we show that the sourcing for sea cucumbers is quite different among shops and different neighborhoods,\u201d said Therkildsen, who is also a faculty fellow at the\nCornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability", "\u201cBy no means was this an exhaustive survey, but it suggests differing sourcing patterns", "\u201d\nTherkildsen recognized that even brown sea cucumbers can be harvested legally in certain parts of the world, but there are no genetic tools yet to trace species origination", "\u201cTo conduct any enforcement at merchant food shops, we need tools that can assign a specimen back to a region from where they are protected and we are currently working on developing such tools,\u201d she said", "Rodenbiker indicated a need for more robust point-of-origination training for the retailers, improved labeling in the markets and public outreach to advance the concept of One Health \u2013 an idea that humans, animals and the environment are all connected \u2013 in urban seafood markets", "\u201cGiven that brown sea cucumbers are abundant on the market,\u201d he said, \u201cthere is a need for developing genetic markers that can trace geographic origin to determine if a species was legally harvested", "\u201d\nFunding for this research was provided by Cornell Atkinson", "Energy, Environment & Sustainability\nHealth,

900 modern and extinct kangaroos.", "\nTraci Klarenbeek/Megafauna Central\nhide caption\ntoggle caption\nTraci Klarenbeek/Megafauna Central\nTens of thousands of years ago, during the late Pleistocene, many large animal species were simply erased from the planet during a widespread extinction.", "\n\"It's a question that's been plaguing paleontology for a couple of hundred years,\" says Sam Arman, a paleontologist at\nMegafauna Central\n, a natural history museum in Australia\nNow, in research published in\nScience\n, Arman and his colleagues say that a detailed analysis of hundreds of ancient and modern kangaroo teeth point to the arrival of humans in Australia playing a larger role in the extinction event than a changing climate.", "\nSponsor Message\nNot everyone agrees, however. \"", "I think looking at one spot in time is not enough to discount the role that climate may play in previous extinctions,\" says\nLarisa DeSantis\n, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University who wasn't involved with the study.", "\nThe question of human- versus climate-induced extinction is an important one since it could help researchers disentangle the forces today that are contributing to the erasure of global biodiversity.", "Then, around eight million years ago, \"Australia became quite arid,\" says Arman.", "\nIn response, kangaroos adapted their locomotion and diets to the drier climate. \"", "That was where kangaroos really hit their strides \u2014 or I suppose their hops \u2014 and diversified into a lot of different groups,\"says Arman.", "\nThere were two major groups of kangaroos.", "There were the long-faced ones, \"which is what you still see today, and that includes things like wallabies,\" says Arman.", "And there were the short-faced ones. \"", "If you plunked a koala head on top of it, you're basically in the right ballpark, just less floofy.\"", "\nAll these kangaroos lived alongside an array of other animals. \"", "We had this marsupial that was the size of a rhino,\" Arman says. \"", "We had a marsupial lion.", "We had all sorts of crazy things.\"", "\nSponsor Message\nThen, about 40,000 to 65,000 years ago, most of these large animal species went extinct, including all of the short-faced kangaroos and some of the long-faced kangaroos.", "And the question is \u2014 why?", "\n\"It really does come down to two arguments,\" says Arman.", "\nThe first is whether humans \u2014 who arrived in Australia around this time \u2014 had something to do with it, perhaps by hunting the kangaroos or altering the landscape.", "\nThe second is related to a change in climate. \"", "If these kangaroos were all just feeding on particular sorts of plants,\" says Arman, \"then perhaps climate change came in and wiped out those plants and then they went extinct because of that.\"", "\nAncient marsupial dentistry\nThis idea that their food disappearing leading to extinction relies on the kangaroos having been specialized eaters.", "Some paleontologists argue this was the case based on differences in kangaroo skull shape and chemistry \u2014 that short-faced kangaroos fed primarily on shrubs and long-faced kangaroos fed mostly on grasses.", "\nArman, however, wasn't so sure. \"", "Adaptation does not necessarily define diet,\" he says.", "He approached the question of ancient kangaroo extinction by taking a detailed look at the teeth of more than 900 kangaroos \u2014 a mix of fossils from Victoria Fossil Cave in South Australia and modern animals from across the country.", "\nThe technique is called dental microwear texture analysis. \"", "Whenever an animal chews its food,\" Arman explains, \"the food leaves marks \u2014 microscopic scratches on the surface of the teeth.", "If we take those teeth and scan them under a very high resolution microscope, we can then compare what these fossil animals were eating at the time.\"", "\nArman and his colleagues found that most of the extinct kangaroos (both the short- and long-faced ones) had mixed diets.", "That is, he says they ate both grasses and shrubs based on what was available.", "The takeaway, Arman suggests, is that starvation brought on by a changing climate may not have wiped out all those kangaroos.", "Instead, the arrival of humans may have.", "\nSponsor Message\n\"It doesn't rule out that climate change is involved in some other way,\" says Arman, \"but it's very hard to tell the story without invoking humans in any way.\"", "\nDeSantis says that in Australia, it's difficult to reconstruct what animals once ate in part because of the diverse landscape. \"", "This paper is really helpful,\" she says, \"but I think it goes a little bit too far \u2014 that these kangaroos were already well adapted to variable climate

Klarenbeek/Megafauna Central\nhide caption\ntoggle caption\nTraci Klarenbeek/Megafauna Central\nTens of thousands of years ago, during the late Pleistocene, many large animal species were simply erased from the planet during a widespread extinction", "In Australia, nearly two dozen kangaroo species vanished \u2014 but the reason hasn't been clear", "\"It's a question that's been plaguing paleontology for a couple of hundred years,\" says Sam Arman, a paleontologist at\nMegafauna Central\n, a natural history museum in Australia\nNow, in research published in\nScience\n, Arman and his colleagues say that a detailed analysis of hundreds of ancient and modern kangaroo teeth point to the arrival of humans in Australia playing a larger role in the extinction event than a changing climate", "Sponsor Message\nNot everyone agrees, however", "\"I think looking at one spot in time is not enough to discount the role that climate may play in previous extinctions,\" says\nLarisa DeSantis\n, a paleontologist at Vanderbilt University who wasn't involved with the study", "The question of human- versus climate-induced extinction is an important one since it could help researchers disentangle the forces today that are contributing to the erasure of global biodiversity", "Kangaroo beginnings\u2026 and endings\nKangaroos evolved from a possum-like ancestor some 20 million years ago", "Then, around eight million years ago, \"Australia became quite arid,\" says Arman", "In response, kangaroos adapted their locomotion and diets to the drier climate", "\"That was where kangaroos really hit their strides \u2014 or I suppose their hops \u2014 and diversified into a lot of different groups,\"says Arman", "There were two major groups of kangaroos", "There were the long-faced ones, \"which is what you still see today, and that includes things like wallabies,\" says Arman", "And there were the short-faced ones", "\"If you plunked a koala head on top of it, you're basically in the right ballpark, just less floofy", "\"\nAll these kangaroos lived alongside an array of other animals", "\"We had this marsupial that was the size of a rhino,\" Arman says", "\"We had a marsupial lion", "We had all sorts of crazy things", "\"\nSponsor Message\nThen, about 40,000 to 65,000 years ago, most of these large animal species went extinct, including all of the short-faced kangaroos and some of the long-faced kangaroos", "And the question is \u2014 why?\n\"It really does come down to two arguments,\" says Arman", "The first is whether humans \u2014 who arrived in Australia around this time \u2014 had something to do with it, perhaps by hunting the kangaroos or altering the landscape", "The second is related to a change in climate", "\"If these kangaroos were all just feeding on particular sorts of plants,\" says Arman, \"then perhaps climate change came in and wiped out those plants and then they went extinct because of that", "\"\nAncient marsupial dentistry\nThis idea that their food disappearing leading to extinction relies on the kangaroos having been specialized eaters", "Some paleontologists argue this was the case based on differences in kangaroo skull shape and chemistry \u2014 that short-faced kangaroos fed primarily on shrubs and long-faced kangaroos fed mostly on grasses", "Arman, however, wasn't so sure", "\"Adaptation does not necessarily define diet,\" he says", "He approached the question of ancient kangaroo extinction by taking a detailed look at the teeth of more than 900 kangaroos \u2014 a mix of fossils from Victoria Fossil Cave in South Australia and modern animals from across the country", "The technique is called dental microwear texture analysis", "\"Whenever an animal chews its food,\" Arman explains, \"the food leaves marks \u2014 microscopic scratches on the surface of the teeth", "If we take those teeth and scan them under a very high resolution microscope, we can then compare what these fossil animals were eating at the time", "\"\nArman and his colleagues found that most of the extinct kangaroos (both the short- and long-faced ones) had mixed diets", "That is, he says they ate both grasses and shrubs based on what was available", "The takeaway, Arman suggests, is that starvation brought on by a changing climate may not have wiped out all those kangaroos", "Instead, the arrival of humans may have", "Sponsor Message\n\"It doesn't rule out that climate change is involved in some other way,\" says Arman, \"but it's very hard to tell the story without invoking humans in any way", "\"\nDeSantis says that in Australia, it's difficult to reconstruct what animals once ate in part because of the diverse landscape", "\"This paper is really helpful,\" she says, \"but I think it goes a little bit too far \u2014 that these kangaroos were already well adapted to variable climate change", "\"\nShe leans towards climate change having more to do with their extinctions", "\"I think you can have a tipping point,\" she says", "\"If things get warm enough, dry enough, these animals are going to have a tough time making it, regardless of whether they're mixed feeders", "\"\nDeSantis says the new research doesn't capture the full picture", "\"It's really important to see if we can disentangle the impacts of climate and humans in the past,\" she says, \"so that we can better understand and anticipate the impacts that we're having on current ecosystems", "\"\nThis is a point that Sam Arman agrees with", "He's hopeful that his current and future work might lead to ways to help modern-day kangaroos \u2014 particularly if the animals can adapt to eating more kinds of plants and live in more habitats than researchers once thought", "\"Especially for some of our species that are becoming rarer,\" he says, \"we can actually consider looking at reintroductions in places where we might think that they'd be poorly adapted", "\"\nIn other words, Arman hopes the kangaroos

3D-scan of a tiny area of the tooth surface, which can then be analysed using algorithms that quantify its texture", "To see how microwear relates to diet, we compiled a massive baseline of modern macropods whose diets we know really well", "This included 17 species, from browsers (like quokkas, mostly eating the leaves of shrubs), through mixed feeders (like red-necked wallabies, eating large contributions of browse and grass) to grazers (like red kangaroos, who mostly eat grass)", "Scans produced in the study", "Each scan is less than a quarter of a millimetre in length", "Sam Arman/MAGNT\nTo understand diets in the Pleistocene, we looked at fossils from Victoria Fossil Cave in the Naracoorte Caves World Heritage Area", "We found overall there was a high degree of mixed feeding taking place at Naracoorte in the Pleistocene", "Four species of short-faced kangaroos and three species of long-faced kangaroos all had very similar diets \u2013 they were mixed feeders", "This alone dispels the notion that all short-faced kangaroos were driven extinct as a direct result of a restricted diet", "Mixed feeding is a common strategy among kangaroos today, especially in parts of Australia with more vegetation", "It allows species to adapt their diets to changing conditions and mixed environments", "Some specialists too\nNot everyone was a mixed feeder at Naracoorte",

suggesting they had specialist diets", "Meanwhile, a now-extinct long-faced kangaroo known as\nProtemnodon\nhad a specialised grazing diet", "These specialists also provide useful info", "Since they

doesn\u2019t focus on the quickly growing industry, it does provide detailed information about dozens of seaweed species commonly found in Alaska.", "That was made possible in part by new genetic

seaweeds\nCultivating seaweed in the tropical belt is radically different compared to the temperate zones.", "Tropical seaweeds, such as Gracilaria and Eucheumatoids, allow for year-round production with growth cycles of only 30 to 45 days.", "This quick turnaround enables farmers to initiate, increase, or pause production in response to market trends or external factors.", "In contrast, temperate seaweeds are typically seasonal crops, primarily farmed during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in Southern Hemisphere.", "For example, kelps are seeded and harvested only once a year, with relatively short time windows for these activities.", "While Pyropia can be partially harvested throughout the season, it is highly perishable in its unprocessed form, necessitating processing facilities that can extend operations.", "Farmers of temperate species must thus meticulously plan ahead to ensure that their harvests align with market demand.", "\nWhether they\u2019re tropical or temperate has many other implications for the farming practices.", "Here are two of the more distinct ones:\nIn temperate zones, the seasonal nature of production requires a land-based hatchery stage to produce seed material for the following farming cycle.", "The\nland-based\nstage for temperate seaweed ensured investment into seedbanks and hatchery work, with the selection of the best-performing crop and improved seed material being available to farmers, either through cooperative hatchery operations (such as used in Japan) or privately owned hatchery operations (such ad used in South Korea).", "In contrast, tropical seaweeds do not necessarily require this step and have predominantly relied on clonal propagation since farming began in the 1970s.", "The lack of a similar infrastructure for tropical seaweeds has resulted in a decreased pool of genetic diversity, making crops more vulnerable to pests, diseases and climate change effects.", "\nMost tropical seaweed farming regions - such as Indonesia (pictured above) - rely on manpower for landing harvested seaweed\nThis is in marked contrast to the mechanical means used by kelp farmers in regions like South Korea (see first image in this feature)\n\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\nPain points for the seaweed industry differ in different regions (click on image to enlarge)\n\u00a9 Hatch Intelligence Services\nAnother significant difference is in post-harvest handling methods.", "Sun drying is the most common method for stabilising biomass in tropical regions due to high sunlight exposure year-round.", "However, this relatively low-cost technique often leads to minimal innovation in processing steps and product development.", "Furthermore, sun drying can destroy valuable compounds in the seaweed.", "On the other hand, temperate regions face challenges related to having short weather windows for harvesting large amounts of biomass simultaneously.", "This has driven farmers to explore diverse alternatives to drying \u2013 especially given the high energy requirements involved \u2013 leading to the exploration of more diverse and innovative product applications.", "\nLastly, a strong differentiating factor between tropical and temperate seaweed farming lies in their socio-economic contexts.", "Tropical seaweed farming often occurs in developing countries within the global South and is dominated by smallholder farmers who operate small farms in less regulated environments.", "For many coastal communities in these regions, seaweed farming is one of the few sources of livelihood, increasing their dependency on this activity while also exposing them to exploitation risks.", "\nIn contrast, temperate regions\u2014typically found in developed countries within the global North\u2014feature more company-type farming businesses due to more regulated access to farming.", "Farmers do have other economic opportunities, so seaweed becomes either a \u201cside gig\u201d as we witness in many North American emerging seaweed farming regions, or the next generations of farmers are lacking due to more attractive employment opportunities in the cities, such as the Japanese and South Korean trends show.", "\nTypical off-bottom tropical seaweed farm in Indonesia\n\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\nEmerging vs established seaweed farming regions\nWhen comparing established versus emerging seaweed farming regions, we see that established areas tend to exhibit a market pull that facilitates scale.", "For instance, East Asia has a long-standing cultural appreciation for seaweed as a staple food source.", "Similarly, Southeast Asia has experienced increased global demand for carrageenan and agar derived from cultivated seaweeds.", "In both cases, markets were initially supplied by wild-harvested seaweed; however, demand quickly outpaced supply, justifying the development of farming.", "\nConversely, many emerging seaweed farming regions perceive aquaculture as an opportunity for people, planet and profit but often lack a clear market pull to justify increased farming operations.", "This situation is frequently compounded by stringent regulatory environments due to the novelty of the activity and limited room for error.", "When seaweed farming began in now-established regions around 50 years ago, there were fewer regulations; now that these markets have matured, they tend to navigate existing businesses and supply chains.", "\nHatch Innovation Services, in collaboration with The Nature Conservancy, recently conducted a deep

ranging from Pacific oysters to ribbon kelp", "But growing them successfully requires in-depth knowledge of dozens of species \u2014 where they grow, when they grow, and under what conditions", "A new tool aims to make that easier", "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a\nnew guide\nearlier this month that chronicles more than 100 species of seaweed commonly found in Alaska", "\u201cTo grow it for the kelp industry, you need to know where you can find those spores, what time of year,\u201d said Jordan Hollarsmith, a mariculture-focused research biologist with NOAA", "\u201cOr if you want to harvest it, to eat it, you need to know what you\u2019re looking for, where you can find that species", "\u201d\nThe guide aims to advance the state\u2019s budding mariculture industry at a time when global demand for kelp products is on the rise", "Alaska mariculture is still tiny compared to other coastal states, like California, Oregon and Washington", "But it is steadily gaining ground", "All told, the state boasts more than 1,300 acres permitted for mariculture, according to a\nNOAA report\nfrom last year", "And more mariculture farms are coming", "On average, Alaska received more than a dozen applications for new sites each year between 2019 and 2023", "That\u2019s more than double the average for the five years prior", "\u201cA decade ago, I don\u2019t know if there was a single farm,\u201d Hollarsmith said", "\u201cAnd now we see multiple around Kodiak, some pretty small-scale ones in Kachemak Bay and in Prince William Sound, and then a few smaller, medium-sized ones and a large one as well in Southeast Alaska", "\u201d\nHollarsmith didn\u2019t author the updated guide", "But she says it will be a crucial tool as the industry develops across the state", "Right now, the highest concentration of mariculture is in Southeast, with forty permitted farms, according to the 2024 report", "NOAA is also exploring where other farms might thrive", "At one point that included the waters around Haines", "But the agency later dropped Haines from the list because the area is near several state marine parks, which cannot overlap with farm lease applications, Alicia Bishop, a regional coordinator for NOAA Fisheries, said in an email", "Siting new farms is one of the key obstacles to growth", "That\u2019s because new sites have to meet several key criteria, including the right environmental conditions and limited overlap with other marine activities", "\u201cYou can\u2019t set your farm where there\u2019s already a fishery, where there\u2019s military installations, a ferry route, those sorts of things,\u201d Hollarsmith said", "Still, the industry is growing \u2013 and fast", "That\u2019s largely due to a $49 million federal grant awarded in 2022 to a coalition of companies, agencies, tribes and researchers working to boost the industry", "NOAA\nsaid at the time\nthat the grant could help grow the industry to be worth nearly $2 billion within the next decade", "A state task force, meanwhile, set a goal in 2016 to develop mariculture into a $100 million industry by 2040", "Driving the state\u2019s interest in part is the industry\u2019s potential to boost Alaska\u2019s coastal economies", "Hollarsmith thinks mariculture could offer more opportunities for people already working on Alaska\u2019s waterfronts", "\u201cWe see a lot of people that participate in commercial fisheries also participating in the mariculture industry,\u201d she said", "Hollarsmith says untapped opportunities for Alaskan oyster farms could also fuel growth", "Kelp, meanwhile, is becoming an increasingly popular health food, and can also be used for other purposes", "The industry is exploring how different species can be used as a strengthening ingredient in concrete, or in fertilizer to boost crop production", "While the new field guide doesn\u2019t focus on the quickly growing industry, it does provide detailed information about dozens of seaweed species commonly found in Alaska", "That was made possible in part by new genetic techniques, like DNA sequencing, that have allowed researchers to better classify seaweed and identify new species over the last decade", "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we\u2019re all using the same name to describe a given species,\u201d Hollarsmith said", "\u201cEspecially in this time of kelp industry growth, when farmers are experimenting with new species and trying to understand what species are out there and what kind of benefits they might have",

potentially translate to a bad year for Florida beaches", "What You Need To Know\nAccording to a University of South Florida report, a six-fold increase in the amount of sargassum in the Atlantic Ocean was detected in December\nSargassum is a kind of seaweed that can grow into massive floating mats that provide food and habitat for marine animals\nWith 2025 expected to be a \"massive sargassum year,\" a USF researcher says it is still unknown what affect it might have on Florida beaches\nA\nDecember report\nby the USF College of Marine Science Optical Oceanography Lab found an abundance of sargassum off the coast of Africa in the Eastern and Western Atlantic", "Sargassum is a type of seaweed that can grow into massive floating mats that provide food and habitat for marine animals", "But experts say too much could also be a problem, as the decomposition of sargassum on beaches can cause an unpleasant odor and possibly exacerbate respiratory issues", "According to the report, in December, the sargassum exceeded 75% of its historical value", "Researchers said that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an indicator of what beachgoers could see on Florida\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Atlantic coast and near the Keys by the mid- to late spring", "University of South Florida optical oceanography professor Chuamin Hu is the report's lead researcher, and said several factors will determine where the sargassum will go", "\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driven by light, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driven by temperature and it requires food,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hu said", "\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny plant

"\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are lucky to be spared every year,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hu said", "According to the report, sargassum growth in January is expected around the Lesser Antilles and the eastern Caribbean Sea, while \"sargassum in the western Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico will likely remain very low", "\"\nWhile the impact could be major, Hu said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also too early to

wear sturdy, closed-toe footwear for this seaweed foraging workshop, which she teaches in Garibaldi through her company,\nShifting Tides", "But it\u2019s immediately evident that Kieffer, who grew up on the East Coast and studied marine biology at Oregon State, is at home out here, confidently navigating slick rocks and dark pools while the rest of us slide and wobble", "She also leads workshops in mussel foraging, bay clamming, crabbing, and tide pooling\u2014in addition to her day job at\nOregon Seaweed\n, where she farms and sells Pacific dulse", "Through her company Shifting Tides, Kieffer (center, in blue cap) leads workshops on coastal foraging", "Image:\nCourtesy Sophia Knox Photography\nPacific dulse is on the menu during\nWinter Waters\n, an event series spotlighting seaweeds, bivalves, and other local seafood at restaurants and businesses up and down the Oregon Coast (and at a few inland locations, including in Portland)", "It began as a single seaweed-focused dinner in 2023, organized by Kieffer, seafood marketer Rachelle Hacmac, and food systems strategist Kristen Penner", "Two years later, it\u2019s a sprawling celebration, running February 1 through March 2, of the many types of ocean farming that can have benefits for the environment, also known as regenerative aquaculture", "Seaweed farms\n, for example, serve as powerful carbon sinks", "Oyster farms sequester nitrogen and filter ocean water; adult Pacific oysters, like the ones that will be served by chef Maylin Ch\u00e1vez at a\nseaweed and oyster social\nat the Redd in Portland on February 18, filter about 50 gallons of water a day before they\u2019re harvested", "Kristen Penner shucks oysters at Winter Waters, an event series she cofounded with Kieffer and Rachelle Hacmac",

to identify a wet, wrinkly patch of dark green nori", "This one we all know from the dried sheet version sold in grocery stores", "Nori is far from her favorite, so she moves on quickly to point out sugar kelp (great for wrapping fish to bake) and sea grapes (fun to squeeze like little water balloons, and which Kieffer once stuffed with ricotta, an achievement of creativity more than flavor)", "We focus on a handful of the tastiest seaweeds, but more than 50 varieties grow in Oregon\u2019s rocky intertidal zone", "While commercial harvesting is strictly regulated, from March 1 to June 15, recreationalists may gather up to one gallon per day, up to a total of three gallons per year", "Bonus: Unlike much\nland-based foraging\n, there\u2019s no serious risk in misidentifying what you

at slippery strands, we climb over boulders to the parking lot, where Kieffer sets up a camp stove and fries some dulse with olive oil, salt, and pepper", "It turns from reddish brown to bright green in a flash and tastes bright and smoky", "Pacific dulse is found in the waters we just picked through, but this one comes from Oregon Seaweed, a land-based farm where dulse is grown in tanks year-round", "(It will also be part of the March 2 tour", ") Pre-pandemic, Kieffer worked at California\u2019s Catalina Island Marine Institute, where she taught shark biology and kayaking classes for kids and spent her free time swimming through the lush kelp forests just offshore", "When COVID-19 hit, she moved to Seaside and soon caught wind that Oregon Seaweed, based in the\nSouth Coast\ntown of Bandon, was building a new site in Garibaldi, 200 miles north and closer to the bigger coastal cities and to Portland, where dulse was increasingly popping up on menus", "In Kieffer's day job at Oregon Seaweed, she farms and sells Pacific dulse, which grows in 1,500-gallon tanks", "Image:\nCourtesy Alanna Kiefer\nA land-based seaweed farm is a pretty simple operation, requiring minimal energy and resources to maintain", "Water is pumped in from the ocean, filtered through a UV light, and then circulated with bubblers in 1,500-gallon tanks that hold the seaweed", "Dulse is a clonal species, so when little bits break off, they keep growing; it doesn\u2019t need to be fed or bred", "As climate change strains global food systems, advocates such as Kieffer envision fast-growing seaweed as a food source for both people and livestock", "Kieffer helped get the tanks up and running, then shifted to sales and promotion, knocking on doors, meeting with chefs and restaurant owners, and encouraging them to add dulse to their dishes", "When Oregon Seaweed needed a place to grind its\ndulse flakes\n, Kieffer had her studio apartment approved by the Oregon Department of Agriculture as a licensed processing facility, and the grinding machine sat on her kitchen table", "The manual work was a mess, and despite hanging bed sheets and strategically positioning fans, seaweed dust coated everything", "(The company has since outsourced the grinding", ") She embarked on her own culinary experiments, too, draping long strands of it over cabinet doors to dry", "Roasted dulse, prepared just like kale chips, became a favorite", "\u201cI wish I could get these into every bar in Portland,\u201d she says", "Kieffer also leads workshops on mussel foraging, bay clamming, crabbing, and

Watch this summary video\nTemperate vs tropical seaweeds\nCultivating seaweed in the tropical belt is radically different compared to the temperate zones", "Tropical seaweeds, such as Gracilaria and Eucheumatoids, allow for year-round production with growth cycles of only 30 to 45 days", "This quick turnaround enables farmers to initiate, increase, or pause production in response to market trends or external factors", "In contrast, temperate seaweeds are typically seasonal crops, primarily farmed during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere and summer in Southern Hemisphere", "For example, kelps are seeded and harvested only once a year, with relatively short time windows for these activities", "While Pyropia can be partially harvested throughout the season, it is highly perishable in its unprocessed form, necessitating processing facilities that can extend operations", "Farmers of temperate species must thus meticulously plan ahead to ensure that their harvests align with market demand", "Whether they\u2019re tropical or temperate has many other implications for the farming practices", "Here are two of the more distinct ones:\nIn temperate zones, the seasonal nature of production requires a land-based hatchery stage to produce seed material for the following farming cycle", "The\nland-based\nstage for temperate seaweed ensured investment into seedbanks and hatchery work, with the selection of the best-performing crop and improved seed material being available to farmers, either through cooperative hatchery operations (such as used in Japan) or privately owned hatchery operations (such ad used in South Korea)", "In contrast, tropical seaweeds do not necessarily require this step and have predominantly relied on clonal propagation since farming began in the 1970s", "The lack of a similar infrastructure for tropical seaweeds has resulted in a decreased pool of genetic diversity, making crops more vulnerable to pests, diseases and climate change effects", "Most tropical seaweed farming regions - such as Indonesia (pictured above) - rely on manpower for landing harvested seaweed\nThis is in marked contrast to the mechanical means used by kelp farmers in regions like South Korea (see first image in this feature)\n\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\nPain points for the seaweed industry differ in different regions (click on image to enlarge)\n\u00a9 Hatch Intelligence Services\nAnother significant difference is in post-harvest handling methods", "Sun drying is the most common method for stabilising biomass in tropical regions due to high sunlight exposure year-round", "However, this relatively low-cost technique often leads to minimal innovation in processing steps and product development", "Furthermore, sun drying can destroy valuable compounds in the seaweed", "On the other hand, temperate regions face challenges related to having short weather windows for harvesting large amounts of biomass simultaneously", "This has driven farmers to explore diverse alternatives to drying \u2013 especially given the high energy requirements involved \u2013 leading to the exploration of more diverse and innovative product applications", "Lastly, a strong differentiating factor between tropical and temperate seaweed farming lies in their socio-economic contexts", "Tropical seaweed farming often occurs in developing countries within the global South and is dominated by smallholder farmers who operate small farms in less regulated environments", "For many coastal communities in these regions, seaweed farming is one of the few sources of livelihood, increasing their dependency on this activity while also exposing them to exploitation risks", "In contrast, temperate regions\u2014typically found in developed countries within the global North\u2014feature more company-type farming businesses due to more regulated access to farming", "Farmers do have other economic opportunities, so seaweed becomes either a \u201cside gig\u201d as we witness in many North American emerging seaweed farming regions, or the next generations of farmers are lacking due to more attractive employment opportunities in the cities, such as the Japanese and South Korean trends show", "Typical off-bottom tropical seaweed farm in Indonesia\n\u00a9 Karlotta Rieve\nEmerging vs established seaweed farming regions\nWhen comparing established versus emerging seaweed farming regions, we see that established areas tend to exhibit a market pull that facilitates scale", "For instance, East Asia has a long-standing cultural appreciation for seaweed as a staple food source", "Similarly, Southeast Asia has experienced increased global demand for carrageenan and agar derived from cultivated seaweeds", "In both cases, markets were initially supplied by wild-harvested seaweed; however, demand quickly outpaced supply, justifying the development of farming", "Conversely, many emerging seaweed farming regions perceive aquaculture as an opportunity for people, planet and profit but often lack a clear market pull to justify increased farming operations", "This situation is frequently compounded by stringent regulatory environments due to the novelty of the activity and limited room for error", "When seaweed farming began in now-established regions around 50 years ago, there were fewer regulations;

used as a strengthening ingredient in concrete, or in fertilizer to boost crop production.", "\nWhile the new field guide doesn\u2019t focus on the quickly growing industry, it does provide detailed information about dozens of seaweed species commonly found in Alaska.", "That was made possible in part by new genetic techniques, like DNA sequencing, that have allowed researchers to better classify seaweed and identify new species over the last decade.", "\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we\u2019re all using the same name to describe a given species,\u201d Hollarsmith said. \u201c",

waters of Southeast Alaska are an ideal environment to grow species ranging from Pacific oysters to ribbon kelp", "But growing them successfully requires in-depth knowledge of dozens of species \u2014 where they grow, when they grow, and under what conditions", "A new tool aims to make that easier", "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a\nnew guide\nearlier this month that chronicles more than 100 species of seaweed commonly found in Alaska", "\u201cTo grow it for the kelp industry, you need to know where you can find those spores, what time of year,\u201d said Jordan Hollarsmith, a mariculture-focused research biologist with NOAA", "\u201cOr if you want to harvest it, to eat it, you need to know what you\u2019re looking for, where you can find that species", "\u201d\nThe guide aims to advance the state\u2019s budding mariculture industry at a time when global demand for kelp products is on the rise", "Alaska mariculture is still tiny compared to other coastal states, like California, Oregon and Washington", "But it is steadily gaining ground", "All told, the state boasts more than 1,300 acres permitted for mariculture, according to a\nNOAA report\nfrom last year", "And more mariculture farms are coming", "On average, Alaska received more than a dozen applications for new sites each year between 2019 and 2023", "That\u2019s more than double the average for the five years prior", "\u201cA decade ago, I don\u2019t know if there was a single farm,\u201d Hollarsmith said", "\u201cAnd now we see multiple around Kodiak, some pretty small-scale ones in Kachemak Bay and in Prince William Sound, and then a few smaller, medium-sized ones and a large one as well in Southeast Alaska", "\u201d\nHollarsmith didn\u2019t author the updated guide", "But she says it will be a crucial tool as the industry develops across the state", "Right now, the highest concentration of mariculture is in Southeast, with forty permitted farms, according to the 2024 report", "NOAA is also exploring where other farms might thrive", "At one point that included the waters around Haines", "But the agency later dropped Haines from the list because the area is near several state marine parks, which cannot overlap with farm lease applications, Alicia Bishop, a regional coordinator for NOAA Fisheries, said in an email", "Siting new farms is one of the key obstacles to growth", "That\u2019s because new sites have to meet several key criteria, including the right environmental conditions and limited overlap with other marine activities", "\u201cYou can\u2019t set your farm where there\u2019s already a fishery, where there\u2019s military installations, a ferry route, those sorts of things,\u201d Hollarsmith said", "Still, the industry is growing \u2013 and fast", "That\u2019s largely due to a $49 million federal grant awarded in 2022 to a coalition of companies, agencies, tribes and researchers working to boost the industry", "NOAA\nsaid at the time\nthat the grant could help grow the industry to be worth nearly $2 billion within the next decade", "A state task force, meanwhile, set a goal in 2016 to develop mariculture into a $100 million industry by 2040", "Driving the state\u2019s interest in part is the industry\u2019s potential to boost Alaska\u2019s coastal economies", "Hollarsmith thinks mariculture could offer more opportunities for people already working on Alaska\u2019s waterfronts", "\u201cWe see a lot of people that participate in commercial fisheries also participating in the mariculture industry,\u201d she said", "Hollarsmith says untapped opportunities for Alaskan oyster farms could also fuel growth", "Kelp, meanwhile, is becoming an increasingly popular health food, and can also be used for other purposes", "The industry is exploring how different species can be used as a strengthening ingredient in concrete, or in fertilizer to boost crop production", "While the new field guide doesn\u2019t focus on the quickly growing industry, it does provide detailed information about dozens of seaweed species commonly found in Alaska", "That was made possible in part by new genetic techniques, like DNA sequencing, that have allowed researchers to better classify seaweed and identify new species over the last decade", "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we\u2019re all using the same name to describe a given species,\u201d Hollarsmith said", "\u201cEspecially in this time of kelp industry growth, when farmers are experimenting with new species and trying to understand what species are out there and what kind of benefits they might have", "\u201d Sea vegetables are versatile, flavor-rich and nutrient-packed", "Image Credit:\nPexels", "com/Valeria

used as a strengthening ingredient in concrete, or in fertilizer to boost crop production.", "\nWhile the new field guide doesn\u2019t focus on the quickly growing industry, it does provide detailed information about dozens of seaweed species commonly found in Alaska.", "That was made possible in part by new genetic techniques, like DNA sequencing, that have allowed researchers to better classify seaweed and identify new species over the last decade.", "\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we\u2019re all using the same name to describe a given species,\u201d Hollarsmith said. \u201c",

chronicles more than 100 species of seaweed commonly found in Alaska", "\u201cTo grow it for the kelp industry, you need to know where you can find those spores, what time of year,\u201d said Jordan Hollarsmith, a mariculture-focused research biologist with NOAA", "\u201cOr if you want to harvest it, to eat it, you need to know what you\u2019re looking for, where you can find that species", "\u201d\nThe guide aims to advance the state\u2019s budding mariculture industry at a time when global demand for kelp products is on the rise", "Alaska mariculture is still tiny compared to other coastal states, like California, Oregon and Washington", "But it is steadily gaining ground", "All told, the state boasts more than 1,300 acres permitted for mariculture, according to a\nNOAA report\nfrom last year", "And more mariculture farms are coming", "On average, Alaska received more than a dozen applications for new sites each year between 2019 and 2023", "That\u2019s more than double the average for the five years prior", "\u201cA decade ago, I don\u2019t know if there was a single farm,\u201d Hollarsmith said", "\u201cAnd now we see multiple around Kodiak, some pretty small-scale ones in Kachemak Bay and in Prince William Sound, and then a few smaller, medium-sized ones and a large one as well in Southeast Alaska", "\u201d\nHollarsmith didn\u2019t author the updated guide", "But she says it will be a crucial tool as the industry develops across the state", "Right now, the highest concentration of mariculture is in Southeast, with forty permitted farms, according to the 2024 report", "NOAA is also exploring where other farms might thrive", "At one point that included the waters around Haines", "But the agency later dropped Haines from the list because the area is near several state marine parks, which cannot overlap with farm lease applications, Alicia Bishop, a regional coordinator for NOAA Fisheries, said in an email", "Siting new farms is one of the key obstacles to growth", "That\u2019s because new sites have to meet several key criteria, including the right environmental conditions and limited overlap with other marine activities", "\u201cYou can\u2019t set your farm where there\u2019s already a fishery, where there\u2019s military installations, a ferry route, those sorts of things,\u201d Hollarsmith said", "Still, the industry is growing \u2013 and fast", "That\u2019s largely due to a $49 million federal grant awarded in 2022 to a coalition of companies, agencies, tribes and researchers working to boost the industry", "NOAA\nsaid at the time\nthat the grant could help grow the industry to be worth nearly $2 billion within the next decade", "A state task force, meanwhile, set a goal in 2016 to develop mariculture into a $100 million industry by 2040", "Driving the state\u2019s interest in part is the industry\u2019s potential to boost Alaska\u2019s coastal economies", "Hollarsmith thinks mariculture could offer more opportunities for people already working on Alaska\u2019s waterfronts", "\u201cWe see a lot of people that participate in commercial fisheries also participating in the mariculture industry,\u201d she said", "Hollarsmith says untapped opportunities for Alaskan oyster farms could also fuel growth", "Kelp, meanwhile, is becoming an increasingly popular health food, and can also be used for other purposes", "The industry is exploring how different species can be used as a strengthening ingredient in concrete, or in fertilizer to boost crop production", "While the new field guide doesn\u2019t focus on the quickly growing industry, it does provide detailed information about dozens of seaweed species commonly found in Alaska", "That was made possible in part by new genetic techniques, like DNA sequencing, that have allowed researchers to better classify seaweed and identify new species over the last decade", "\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we\u2019re all using the same name to describe a given species,\u201d Hollarsmith said", "\u201cEspecially in this time of kelp industry growth, when farmers are experimenting with new species and trying to
