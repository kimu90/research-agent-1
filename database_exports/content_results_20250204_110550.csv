It's laced through the entire line: brand founder Tiffany Masterson believes it to be superior to anyoilshe's tried and preaches a host of skin benefits, not least from its high content of fatty acids and antioxidants.\nShe's not alone. Word about the wonders of marula oil (which can also be listed as 'sclerocarya birrea') has reached brands beyond the realms of skincare. Now it's not only the soothing companion in yourretinol serum, but also in your detangling hair spray, gradual tan and body lotions.\nWondering where to start? We spoke to expert dermatologists and hair stylists for everything you need to know about this magic, multipurpose ingredient.\n\""Marula oil is extracted from either the nut, seeds or fruit of the African Marula Tree,\"" says consultant dermatologistDr. Sharon Wong.\nAnd while other parts of the Marula Tree are used for food and medicinal purposes, since bursting onto the beauty scene, its oil has been especially recognised for its lightweight formula and hydrating properties. As it\u2019s non-greasy, hydrating and has a fruity scent with a slight nutty undertone, it's especially useful as a treat for skin and hair in need of a boost.\nAs it\u2019s rich in antioxidants and fatty acids, marula oil is best for nourishing the skin. \u201cIt helps to soothe dry, irritated skin by supporting the skin barrier and locking in moisture,\u201d says consultant dermatologistDr. Derrick Phillips.\n\""Marula oil helps to reduce the amount of water that is lost from the skin by forming a lightweight layer,\u201d explains Dr. Wong. \u201cKey amino acids (L-arginine and glutamic acid) then work hard to trap moisture into the skin.\u201d A hydrated skin barrier means bouncy, luminous looking skin, while fewer dry patches means that makeup also sits nicely on top.\nAs for marula oil's antioxidant properties, it works hard to protect skin (on the body, as well as the face) from environmental damage, making it perfect for city dwellers and sunbathers alike. \""It's rich inVitamin Cand E, and phytochemicals called catechins,\"" says Dr. Wong. \""These antioxidant effects help to combat damaging oxidative stress and free radicals caused by pollution and UV rays.\""\nEven better, marula oil also has greatanti-ageingbenefits. \u201cIt can slow down the loss ofcollagenand elastin, two important proteins for maintaining skin elasticity and preventing the development of fine lines and wrinkles,\u201d explains Dr. Phillips. Helping to protect the structure and bounce that comes with youthful skin, marula oil is a great youth-preserver to add to your routine.\nDr. Wong says that dry, dehydrated and normal skin types will benefit from marula oil most, and warns that it isn't always suitable for those with oily skin. \""It has a high ratio of oleic and linoleic acids, meaning it's potentially more comodogenic (pore-blocking) compared to oils with a lower linoleic acid content,\"" she explains.\nDr. Phillips adds that \u201cthose who are prone to acne should also use caution, as it may be too rich for their skin and trigger breakouts.\u201d\nDr. Wong advises applying the oil straight on to bare skin after cleansing, unless you're also using a toner, essence or water-based serum, in which case follow the rule of 'thin to thick' and apply those first, then apply your oil. As always, follow with anymoisturisersand anSPF.\nAs for frequency, marula oil is safe to be used daily \u2013 Dr. Phillips recommends either in the morning or evening as part of your skincare routine. \u201cIt works well with serums likehyaluronic acidfor added hydration, but should not be layered with heavy oils, to avoid overloading the skin,\u201d he says.\nTo use in haircare, add a few drops of oil to yourshampooorconditioner, or apply a touch to dry hair and brush through with fingers or a comb.\""As it's packed with amino acids, marula oil can help to improve shine and fullness. It's great for taming frizz, flyaways and dry ends - without weighing hair down.\"" says Dr. Wong.\nMarula oil in its purest form, with a dash of vitamin E.

The oil has amino acids, fatty acids, and antioxidants that may benefit the hair, skin, and nails.\nMarula oil comes from the marula fruit tree (\nSclerocarya birrea\n), which is found in southern Africa. The oil primarily comes from the kernels of the tree. It is pale yellow and has a slightly nutty scent.\nThough marula oil is becoming a more popular ingredient in cosmetic products, it has been used by people living in southern African regions for\nthousands of years\nas a food, medicinal treatment, and moisturizer, as well as in traditional rituals.\nThis article discusses marula oil in more detail, including its benefits, how to use it, and potential side effects. The article also explores the differences between marula oil and\nargan oil\n.\nMarula oil benefits\nShare on Pinterest\nNadine Greeff/Stocksy\nAccording to\n2018 research\n, marula oil has a composition of:\nAmino acids:\nThe oil contains\namino acids\n, such as\nL-arginine\n, additional\n2018 research\nsays. This helps build\nprotein\nin the body. They also help regulate skin hydration and skin pH levels, per a\n2021 research review\n.\nFatty acids:\nMarula oil also contains\nfatty acids\n, according to\n2015 research\n. These include oleic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, palmitoleic acid, and stearic acid. Fatty acids are a\ncommon ingredient\nin moisturizers.\nAntioxidants:\nVarious parts of the marula fruit tree contain\nantioxidants\n. These substances help slow damage to cells, including skin cells.\nThe oil may have potential benefits for parts of the body, including:\nHair:\nMarula oil may help to strengthen and moisturize dry, brittle, or\ndamaged hair\n, according to\n2018 research\n. However, further conclusive research into the effect of marula oil on hair is necessary.\nSkin:\nThe oil has hydrating and moisturizing properties on very\ndry skin\n, the same 2018 research says. The skin absorbs it well, so it may act quickly.\nNails:\nA person may use marula oil to moisturize the nail beds and cuticles. This may help reduce hangnails and cracked skin around the nails. However, research into the effects of marula oil on nails is needed.\nIt is important to note that marula oil has not been widely studied. Further research is necessary to confirm all of its properties and how they may benefit a person\u2019s health and well-being.\nMarula oil side effects\nCurrent research does not indicate side effects associated with using marula oil. A\n2015 study\nsuggested that marula oil was not irritating when applied to the skin.\nHowever, scientific research into the side effects of marula oil is lacking. So, short- and long-term side effects are possible when using this oil.\nPeople should consider performing a\npatch test\nbefore using marula oil on their face or all over their skin. A patch test can help determine if marula oil or products containing marula oil may cause irritation or an\nallergic reaction\n.\nA person may consider speaking with a primary doctor or dermatologist before using marula oil on their skin.\nHow to use marula oil\nSome cosmetic companies add marula oil to their products. People should make sure to read the ingredients and follow the directions provided for products containing marula oil.\nPeople can use the oil itself in a number of ways, per\n2015 research\n. A person may use it on their:\nHair:\nA person can drop a small amount of oil into their palms and massage it throughout their hair before styling it. People may also try massaging it into the ends of their hair to help prevent split ends and dryness. Alternatively, a person may add a few drops into their shampoo and then massage it into their scalp and hair.\nFace:\nA person may try adding a few drops of marula oil to their hands and gently massaging it onto their face. People should avoid getting the oil in their eyes because it may cause irritation.\nNails:\nPeople can rub marula oil into the skin around their nails. A person may wish to try this after removing nail polish or acrylic nails because these processes can make the nails feel dry and brittle.\nBody:\nA person may use marula oil as a lotion or in addition to one. People can apply the oil liberally over their skin after showering or bathing.\nPeople should consider speaking with a healthcare professional for advice before using marula oil for the first time.\nIf a person notices a\nrash\nor other signs of irritation after use, they should stop using it.\nMarula oil vs. argan oil\nMarula oil and argan oil are used in a variety of hair and skin care products.\nArgan oil comes from the kernels of the Argan tree (\nArgania spinosa\n), which is native to Morocco. Similar to marula oil, argan oil also has hydrating and moisturizing properties,\n2018 research\nsays.\nHowever, the oils differ in their fatty acid profiles.\nMarula oil contains high levels of oleic acid. One 2015 study suggests that the oil contains\n69%\noleic acid.\nArgan oil contains slightly lower levels of oleic acid than marula oil. One 2020 study suggests that argan oil contains around\n46.6%\noleic acid.\nHowever, argan oil contains higher levels of linoleic acid than marula oil.\nThe same 2020 study states that argan oil contains roughly\n32.6%\nlinoleic acid. The previously mentioned 2015 study suggests that marula oil contains\n9.2%\nlinoleic acid.\nYet researchers must look further into both oils to fully understand their properties and their effects on the body.\nA person may consider consulting a doctor or dermatologist before using products containing either oil or the oils themselves.\nOutlook\nMarula oil is high in amino acids, antioxidants, and fatty acids. People may find it in hair, nail, and skin care products.\nCurrent research indicates that it is an ingredient with minimal side effects. However, researchers must conduct further studies to confirm how the oil may affect the body.\nA person should consider conducting a patch test before using marula oil for the first time.

But growing them successfully requires in-depth knowledge of dozens of species \u2014 where they grow, when they grow, and under what conditions.\nA new tool aims to make that easier.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a\nnew guide\nearlier this month that chronicles more than 100 species of seaweed commonly found in Alaska.\n\u201cTo grow it for the kelp industry, you need to know where you can find those spores, what time of year,\u201d said Jordan Hollarsmith, a mariculture-focused research biologist with NOAA. \u201cOr if you want to harvest it, to eat it, you need to know what you\u2019re looking for, where you can find that species.\u201d\nThe guide aims to advance the state\u2019s budding mariculture industry at a time when global demand for kelp products is on the rise. Alaska mariculture is still tiny compared to other coastal states, like California, Oregon and Washington. But it is steadily gaining ground. All told, the state boasts more than 1,300 acres permitted for mariculture, according to a\nNOAA report\nfrom last year.\nAnd more mariculture farms are coming. On average, Alaska received more than a dozen applications for new sites each year between 2019 and 2023. That\u2019s more than double the average for the five years prior.\n\u201cA decade ago, I don\u2019t know if there was a single farm,\u201d Hollarsmith said. \u201cAnd now we see multiple around Kodiak, some pretty small-scale ones in Kachemak Bay and in Prince William Sound, and then a few smaller, medium-sized ones and a large one as well in Southeast Alaska.\u201d\nHollarsmith didn\u2019t author the updated guide. But she says it will be a crucial tool as the industry develops across the state. Right now, the highest concentration of mariculture is in Southeast, with forty permitted farms, according to the 2024 report.\nNOAA is also exploring where other farms might thrive. At one point that included the waters around Haines. But the agency later dropped Haines from the list because the area is near several state marine parks, which cannot overlap with farm lease applications, Alicia Bishop, a regional coordinator for NOAA Fisheries, said in an email.\nSiting new farms is one of the key obstacles to growth. That\u2019s because new sites have to meet several key criteria, including the right environmental conditions and limited overlap with other marine activities.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t set your farm where there\u2019s already a fishery, where there\u2019s military installations, a ferry route, those sorts of things,\u201d Hollarsmith said.\nStill, the industry is growing \u2013 and fast.\nThat\u2019s largely due to a $49 million federal grant awarded in 2022 to a coalition of companies, agencies, tribes and researchers working to boost the industry. NOAA\nsaid at the time\nthat the grant could help grow the industry to be worth nearly $2 billion within the next decade. A state task force, meanwhile, set a goal in 2016 to develop mariculture into a $100 million industry by 2040.\nDriving the state\u2019s interest in part is the industry\u2019s potential to boost Alaska\u2019s coastal economies. Hollarsmith thinks mariculture could offer more opportunities for people already working on Alaska\u2019s waterfronts.\n\u201cWe see a lot of people that participate in commercial fisheries also participating in the mariculture industry,\u201d she said.\nHollarsmith says untapped opportunities for Alaskan oyster farms could also fuel growth. Kelp, meanwhile, is becoming an increasingly popular health food, and can also be used for other purposes. The industry is exploring how different species can be used as a strengthening ingredient in concrete, or in fertilizer to boost crop production.\nWhile the new field guide doesn\u2019t focus on the quickly growing industry, it does provide detailed information about dozens of seaweed species commonly found in Alaska. That was made possible in part by new genetic techniques, like DNA sequencing, that have allowed researchers to better classify seaweed and identify new species over the last decade.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we\u2019re all using the same name to describe a given species,\u201d Hollarsmith said. \u201cEspecially in this time of kelp industry growth, when farmers are experimenting with new species and trying to understand what species are out there and what kind of benefits they might have.\u201d"", ""More than 800 varieties are available along its 7,500-km coastline\nA woman collects seaweed in the waters off the coast of Rameswaram in India's Tamil Nadu state. \u00a9 AFP/Jiji\nNAGAPATTINAM, India -- Dressed in a shirt over her saree, plastic goggles on her eyes and cloth covering her hands to prevent her from being scratched by coral, Lakshmi Muthu, 54, dips into shallow ocean water and collects clumps of greenish seaweed.\nWomen like Muthu have traditionally collected up to 30 kilograms of seaweed in a day from waters near Pamban Island, located between India and Sri Lanka.

The brownish looking seaweed variety is called sargassum and is flooding the shores of South Florida this year.\nThere aren\u2019t many seasons in South Florida. The wet season. The dry season. Storm season. And sargassum season.\nSargassum is the formal name of the leafy brown seaweed that floats on top of the ocean and is blown ashore in Florida beginning in the spring. There\u2019s a lot of it out in the Atlantic Ocean now and it could be headed to the sands of South Florida later this spring.\nSargassum blooms have become almost an annual event in the Caribbean since 2011. There are \""strong signs\"" this year will be \""another major year\"" for seaweed, according to the University of South Florida Optical Oceanography Lab.\nThe Florida Roundup's Tom Hudson spoke with Brian Barnes, research associate at USF's College of Marine Science. The conversation was edited for length and clarity.\nHUDSON: How much sargassum is out there way out at sea right now?\nBARNES: There's a lot. Right now, I think we have around 4 million tons of sargassum out there in the central Atlantic,\nwhich is a lot for this time of year\n. We're seeing a lot \u2014 and a lot more than we've seen in the last couple of years.\nWhat does that mean? What does it mean if there is a likelihood of a major seaweed season?\nThe sargassum, when it's offshore, is a good thing. It's a habitat. There's a lot of fisheries, a lot of animals, invertebrates that depend on it. A major sargassum year just means that there's a lot of sargassum in this area that we call the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt. It goes from Africa all the way in through the Caribbean and sometimes impacts Florida. A major sargassum season means we have a lot of sargassum. Some of this can roll-up onto beaches and start causing economic environmental issues for those areas. But just because there's a lot of sargassum in the greater Atlantic doesn't mean we're going to have those severe impacts.\nWhat does the amount of sargassum here in an early calendar year tell us about the marine or environmental conditions of the water?\nSargassum is just like a typical plant that you would have around your house. As long as you've got a seed population and then the right nutrients, the right temperature environment and so forth, then the organism will start to grow and multiply and expand. We've seen an explosive growth in the central Atlantic. The question now becomes, do the winds and the currents carry all that sargassum into areas in the Caribbean and eventually into Florida that it might cause problems for beach goers and so forth?\nscreenshot\n/\nUniversity of South Florida Optical Oceanography Lab\nA screenshot of the Dec. 2024 sargassum bloom in the Atlantic Ocean.\nWhat about the risks to the peninsula and both sides of the peninsula and the panhandle? Can it get around the straits of Florida into the Gulf?\nIt comes in between the Yucatan Peninsula and Cuba, and then it rides the Loop Current, which kind of goes up north a little bit and then turns right back around. We don't see many impacts, many landings of sargassum on the west coast of Florida just because it's riding that Loop Current all the way out the Straits of Florida. Once you get off into the Keys, you can see large inundations in the Florida Keys and the Miami area going all the way up the Treasure Coast.\nREAD MORE:\nCould new invasive seagrass in South Florida doom one of the best defenses to climate change?\nWhat about the timing if it is to blow into Florida?\nThe earliest we typically see any kind of major inundations in Florida would be March timeframe. But usually the more substantial impacts are in May and into the summer months. It's really early to make any predictions about what might be impacts to Florida other than that, if they occur, there'll be several months away.\nYou mentioned potential economic impact because it can crowd beaches and there's an expense to remove it. Is it dangerous at all? Should we not touch it?\nIt\u2019s not great to be in and around the sargassum, but the impacts to human health are just the smell and respiratory distress from the decaying matter as it's washed up on beaches.\nIf you've got a beach day, do you look at that sargassum forecast before you head out with your umbrella and chairs?\nYes and no. The sargassum forecast is a monthly retrospective now. It provides data on the level of the entire ocean. What we're working on now is getting into that granular level \u2013 this particular beach (for example), impacted on this particular day rather than something like the Florida Keys may get some impacts in a couple of months. That is kind of the frontiers that we're pushing with some of our new funding from NOAA \u2013 to try and get into that granular level of being able to advise beachgoers as to whether a particular beach would be impacted by sargassum on a particular day or week.\nIf you're successful with that, might we see a new type of flag at the beach? There's a marine life flag. There's a wind flag. Might there be a sargassum flag?\nI like that. The surf warning. Red tide warning and the sargassum warning.

Here, we quantify carbon burial in 20 seaweed farms distributed globally, ranging from 2 to 300\u2009years in operation and from 1 to 15,000\u2009ha in size. The thickness of sediment layers and stocks of organic carbon accumulated below the farms increased with farm age, reaching 140\u2009tC\u2009ha\n\u22121\nfor the oldest farm. Organic carbon burial rates averaged 1.87\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73\u2009tCO\n2\ne\u2009ha\n\u22121\nyr\n\u22121\nin farm sediments, twice that in reference sediments. The excess CO\n2\ne burial attributable to the seaweed farms averaged 1.06\u2009\u00b1\u20090.74\u2009CO\n2\ne\u2009ha\n\u22121\nyr\n\u22121\n, confirming that seaweed farming in depositional environments buries carbon in the underlying sediments at rates towards the low range of that of Blue Carbon habitats, but increasing with farm age.\nThis is a preview of subscription content,\naccess via your institution\nAccess options\nAccess through your institution\nChange institution\nBuy or subscribe\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n24,99\u00a0\u20ac\n/\u00a030\u00a0days\ncancel any time\nLearn more\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n195,33\u00a0\u20ac per year\nonly 16,28 \u20ac per issue\nLearn more\nBuy this article\nPurchase on SpringerLink\nInstant access to full article PDF\nBuy now\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nLog in\nLearn about institutional subscriptions\nRead our FAQs\nContact customer support\nFig. 1: Location of the sampled seaweed farms, the time (years) elapsed since the onset of farming and the size of the harvested area (ha).\nFig. 2: Duration of farming operation and sediment C accumulation.\nFig. 3: Carbon burial and farm yield.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nSubstantial blue carbon sequestration in the world\u2019s largest seagrass meadow\nArticle\nOpen access\n13 December 2023\nThe blue carbon of southern southwest Atlantic salt marshes and their biotic and abiotic drivers\nArticle\nOpen access\n22 December 2023\nHigh variability of Blue Carbon storage in seagrass meadows at the estuary scale\nArticle\nOpen access\n03 April 2020\nData availability\nData are provided in Tables\n1\nand\n2\n, reporting sedimentation rates and deposit thickness and carbon stock and burial, and farm location, depth, seaweed yield and species farmed, respectively, derived at the farm level.

While the mineral is essential for healthy thyroid function, too much can have the opposite effect, potentially causing your thyroid to slow down or speed up, according to a June 2019 paper in the \u200c\nAnnals of the New York Academy of Sciences\n\u200c. So don't overdo it, Reisdorf says.\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nIt's also a good idea to check with your doctor about eating seaweed if you have an existing thyroid problem. In that case, you may need to limit your intake.\nSeaweed also has the potential to absorb heavy metals from its surrounding environment, including arsenic and lead, per January 2023 research by the\nEuropean Food Safety Authority\n. \""So look for reputable brands that test for contaminants,\"" Barkyoumb says.\nAdvertisement\nTry these brands:\nGimme Seaweed\nMaine Coast Sea Vegetables\nOcean's Balance\nTypes of Sea Vegetables\nSure, the nori used to wrap your sushi is tasty. But when it comes to the wide world of sea vegetables, that's just the beginning. Different varieties of seaweed have different textures and flavors \u2014 and they work well in different kinds of dishes.\nAdvertisement\nHere's a look at some of the most popular options:\nArame\nMild and slightly sweet, arame is a type of seaweed that's cooked, shredded and sun-dried. The fine texture is good for adding to grain salads, veggie burgers and stir-fry dishes.\nDuckweed (Mankai)\nThe leafy green aquatic plant, which is sometimes called mankai, has garnered attention for its high protein and antioxidant content. Fresh duckweed can be added to salads or soups, but it's not easy to track down at most grocery stores.\nAdvertisement\nYou may be able to get similar benefits with dried duckweed powder, which can be added to smoothies.
