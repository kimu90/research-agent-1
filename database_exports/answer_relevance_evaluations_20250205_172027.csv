profit of less than $250 per cow per year. \u201c"", ""This means that almost half \u2014 and often more \u2014 of the profit per cow would go toward paying for Bovaer on the vast majority of U.S.

Tamer profitable for farmers."", ""\nMethane taxes."", ""Products made from cows given feed additives would pay a lower tax, potentially making them cheaper."", ""Denmark is the pioneer in this space: in 2030, the country\u2019s farmers will pay a tax of $43 per ton of livestock methane."", ""Ag taxes are unlikely to fly at a federal level in the U.S., but last week Democrats in Washington state introduced a bill requiring farmers to report methane emissions, prompting speculation that the same lawmakers are planning a methane tax in the future."", ""\nCarbon credits."", ""These could be sold on the voluntary carbon market or purchased as insets, credits that can be used to offset value-chain emissions."", ""Athian is a U.S. company that allows food companies to generate insets by investing in on-farm climate solutions."", ""Last September, it introduced a protocol for use of Bovaer."", ""The company would not share details of its customers but said that it expected to have

the most enticing possibility is that farmers won\u2019t need to be compensated because the additives will pay for themselves."", ""Cattle devote significant amounts of energy to creating methane and

strengthening ingredient in concrete, or in fertilizer to boost crop production."", ""\nWhile the new field guide doesn\u2019t focus on the quickly growing industry, it does provide detailed
