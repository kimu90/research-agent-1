It's laced through the entire line: brand founder Tiffany Masterson believes it to be superior to anyoilshe's tried and preaches a host of skin benefits, not least from its high content of fatty acids and antioxidants.\nShe's not alone. Word about the wonders of marula oil (which can also be listed as 'sclerocarya birrea') has reached brands beyond the realms of skincare. Now it's not only the soothing companion in yourretinol serum, but also in your detangling hair spray, gradual tan and body lotions.\nWondering where to start? We spoke to expert dermatologists and hair stylists for everything you need to know about this magic, multipurpose ingredient.\n\""Marula oil is extracted from either the nut, seeds or fruit of the African Marula Tree,\"" says consultant dermatologistDr. Sharon Wong.\nAnd while other parts of the Marula Tree are used for food and medicinal purposes, since bursting onto the beauty scene, its oil has been especially recognised for its lightweight formula and hydrating properties. As it\u2019s non-greasy, hydrating and has a fruity scent with a slight nutty undertone, it's especially useful as a treat for skin and hair in need of a boost.\nAs it\u2019s rich in antioxidants and fatty acids, marula oil is best for nourishing the skin. \u201cIt helps to soothe dry, irritated skin by supporting the skin barrier and locking in moisture,\u201d says consultant dermatologistDr. Derrick Phillips.\n\""Marula oil helps to reduce the amount of water that is lost from the skin by forming a lightweight layer,\u201d explains Dr. Wong. \u201cKey amino acids (L-arginine and glutamic acid) then work hard to trap moisture into the skin.\u201d A hydrated skin barrier means bouncy, luminous looking skin, while fewer dry patches means that makeup also sits nicely on top.\nAs for marula oil's antioxidant properties, it works hard to protect skin (on the body, as well as the face) from environmental damage, making it perfect for city dwellers and sunbathers alike. \""It's rich inVitamin Cand E, and phytochemicals called catechins,\"" says Dr. Wong. \""These antioxidant effects help to combat damaging oxidative stress and free radicals caused by pollution and UV rays.\""\nEven better, marula oil also has greatanti-ageingbenefits. \u201cIt can slow down the loss ofcollagenand elastin, two important proteins for maintaining skin elasticity and preventing the development of fine lines and wrinkles,\u201d explains Dr. Phillips. Helping to protect the structure and bounce that comes with youthful skin, marula oil is a great youth-preserver to add to your routine.\nDr. Wong says that dry, dehydrated and normal skin types will benefit from marula oil most, and warns that it isn't always suitable for those with oily skin. \""It has a high ratio of oleic and linoleic acids, meaning it's potentially more comodogenic (pore-blocking) compared to oils with a lower linoleic acid content,\"" she explains.\nDr. Phillips adds that \u201cthose who are prone to acne should also use caution, as it may be too rich for their skin and trigger breakouts.\u201d\nDr. Wong advises applying the oil straight on to bare skin after cleansing, unless you're also using a toner, essence or water-based serum, in which case follow the rule of 'thin to thick' and apply those first, then apply your oil. As always, follow with anymoisturisersand anSPF.\nAs for frequency, marula oil is safe to be used daily \u2013 Dr. Phillips recommends either in the morning or evening as part of your skincare routine. \u201cIt works well with serums likehyaluronic acidfor added hydration, but should not be layered with heavy oils, to avoid overloading the skin,\u201d he says.\nTo use in haircare, add a few drops of oil to yourshampooorconditioner, or apply a touch to dry hair and brush through with fingers or a comb.\""As it's packed with amino acids, marula oil can help to improve shine and fullness. It's great for taming frizz, flyaways and dry ends - without weighing hair down.\"" says Dr. Wong.\nMarula oil in its purest form, with a dash of vitamin E.

The oil has amino acids, fatty acids, and antioxidants that may benefit the hair, skin, and nails.\nMarula oil comes from the marula fruit tree (\nSclerocarya birrea\n), which is found in southern Africa. The oil primarily comes from the kernels of the tree. It is pale yellow and has a slightly nutty scent.\nThough marula oil is becoming a more popular ingredient in cosmetic products, it has been used by people living in southern African regions for\nthousands of years\nas a food, medicinal treatment, and moisturizer, as well as in traditional rituals.\nThis article discusses marula oil in more detail, including its benefits, how to use it, and potential side effects. The article also explores the differences between marula oil and\nargan oil\n.\nMarula oil benefits\nShare on Pinterest\nNadine Greeff/Stocksy\nAccording to\n2018 research\n, marula oil has a composition of:\nAmino acids:\nThe oil contains\namino acids\n, such as\nL-arginine\n, additional\n2018 research\nsays. This helps build\nprotein\nin the body. They also help regulate skin hydration and skin pH levels, per a\n2021 research review\n.\nFatty acids:\nMarula oil also contains\nfatty acids\n, according to\n2015 research\n. These include oleic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, palmitoleic acid, and stearic acid. Fatty acids are a\ncommon ingredient\nin moisturizers.\nAntioxidants:\nVarious parts of the marula fruit tree contain\nantioxidants\n. These substances help slow damage to cells, including skin cells.\nThe oil may have potential benefits for parts of the body, including:\nHair:\nMarula oil may help to strengthen and moisturize dry, brittle, or\ndamaged hair\n, according to\n2018 research\n. However, further conclusive research into the effect of marula oil on hair is necessary.\nSkin:\nThe oil has hydrating and moisturizing properties on very\ndry skin\n, the same 2018 research says. The skin absorbs it well, so it may act quickly.\nNails:\nA person may use marula oil to moisturize the nail beds and cuticles. This may help reduce hangnails and cracked skin around the nails. However, research into the effects of marula oil on nails is needed.\nIt is important to note that marula oil has not been widely studied. Further research is necessary to confirm all of its properties and how they may benefit a person\u2019s health and well-being.\nMarula oil side effects\nCurrent research does not indicate side effects associated with using marula oil. A\n2015 study\nsuggested that marula oil was not irritating when applied to the skin.\nHowever, scientific research into the side effects of marula oil is lacking. So, short- and long-term side effects are possible when using this oil.\nPeople should consider performing a\npatch test\nbefore using marula oil on their face or all over their skin. A patch test can help determine if marula oil or products containing marula oil may cause irritation or an\nallergic reaction\n.\nA person may consider speaking with a primary doctor or dermatologist before using marula oil on their skin.\nHow to use marula oil\nSome cosmetic companies add marula oil to their products. People should make sure to read the ingredients and follow the directions provided for products containing marula oil.\nPeople can use the oil itself in a number of ways, per\n2015 research\n. A person may use it on their:\nHair:\nA person can drop a small amount of oil into their palms and massage it throughout their hair before styling it. People may also try massaging it into the ends of their hair to help prevent split ends and dryness. Alternatively, a person may add a few drops into their shampoo and then massage it into their scalp and hair.\nFace:\nA person may try adding a few drops of marula oil to their hands and gently massaging it onto their face. People should avoid getting the oil in their eyes because it may cause irritation.\nNails:\nPeople can rub marula oil into the skin around their nails. A person may wish to try this after removing nail polish or acrylic nails because these processes can make the nails feel dry and brittle.\nBody:\nA person may use marula oil as a lotion or in addition to one. People can apply the oil liberally over their skin after showering or bathing.\nPeople should consider speaking with a healthcare professional for advice before using marula oil for the first time.\nIf a person notices a\nrash\nor other signs of irritation after use, they should stop using it.\nMarula oil vs. argan oil\nMarula oil and argan oil are used in a variety of hair and skin care products.\nArgan oil comes from the kernels of the Argan tree (\nArgania spinosa\n), which is native to Morocco. Similar to marula oil, argan oil also has hydrating and moisturizing properties,\n2018 research\nsays.\nHowever, the oils differ in their fatty acid profiles.\nMarula oil contains high levels of oleic acid. One 2015 study suggests that the oil contains\n69%\noleic acid.\nArgan oil contains slightly lower levels of oleic acid than marula oil. One 2020 study suggests that argan oil contains around\n46.6%\noleic acid.\nHowever, argan oil contains higher levels of linoleic acid than marula oil.\nThe same 2020 study states that argan oil contains roughly\n32.6%\nlinoleic acid. The previously mentioned 2015 study suggests that marula oil contains\n9.2%\nlinoleic acid.\nYet researchers must look further into both oils to fully understand their properties and their effects on the body.\nA person may consider consulting a doctor or dermatologist before using products containing either oil or the oils themselves.\nOutlook\nMarula oil is high in amino acids, antioxidants, and fatty acids. People may find it in hair, nail, and skin care products.\nCurrent research indicates that it is an ingredient with minimal side effects. However, researchers must conduct further studies to confirm how the oil may affect the body.\nA person should consider conducting a patch test before using marula oil for the first time. People may also consider speaking with a doctor or dermatologist for advice."", ""Abstract\nIntroduction\nMaterials and Methods\nResults\nDiscussion\nConclusion\nData Availability Statement\nAuthor Contributions\nFunding\nConflict of Interest\nPublisher\u2019s Note\nAcknowledgments\nSupplementary Material\nReferences"", ""Safety and efficacy of Sclerocarya birrea (A.Rich.)
