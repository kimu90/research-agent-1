DATA-DRIVEN RESEARCH SYNTHESIS PROMPT

Objective: Generate a data-integrated research overview for [SPECIES_NAME] that directly incorporates provided dataset metrics

Required Data Integration:
- Extract and cite specific numerical values from the dataset
- Reference exact measurements and statistics when available
- Use quantitative trends to support qualitative statements
- Incorporate statistical patterns from the provided data
- Connect data points to broader research themes

Structure Guidelines:
- Begin with most statistically significant findings from the data
- Flow naturally between data-supported topics
- Avoid generic literature review statements without data backing
- Integrate numerical evidence throughout the narrative
- Reference specific metrics while maintaining readability
- Exclude methodology descriptions and data source references

Output Parameters:
- Length: 400-600 words
- Style: Professional, authoritative research summary
- Format: Flowing paragraphs without numbering or subsections
- Variables: Use [SPECIES_NAME] consistently
- Tone: Data-driven but accessible

Focus Areas:
- Research trends supported by dataset metrics
- Quantified research impacts and outcomes
- Measured ecological and biological parameters
- Statistical evidence of significance
- Data-verified future research directions

Note: Every major claim should be supported by at least one specific data point from the provided dataset.
