RESEARCH COLLABORATION NETWORK PROMPT

Objective: Generate an interpretation of co-authorship networks studying [SPECIES_NAME]

Required Data Integration:
- Map collaboration cluster sizes
- Identify central network nodes
- Quantify collaboration frequencies
- Measure network density
- Track cross-institutional connections
- Calculate network centrality metrics

Network Analysis Guidelines:
- Describe collaboration patterns
- Identify research cluster formations
- Highlight bridging researchers
- Note isolated research groups
- Analyze network connectivity strength
- Map geographical collaboration bridges

Output Parameters:
- Length: 150-200 words
- Style: Network analysis narrative
- Format: Flowing description of collaboration patterns
- Focus: Research community structure
- Tone: Analytical, connectivity-focused

Key Visualization Points:
- Major collaboration hubs
- Research sub-communities
- Connection strengths
- Network evolution patterns
- Cross-disciplinary bridges
- International collaboration links

Note: All network observations must be supported by visible connection patterns in the visualization.
